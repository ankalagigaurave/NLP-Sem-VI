            "Thousands of demonstrators have marched through London to protest the war in Iraq and demand the withdrawal of British troops from that country . Iranian officials say they expect to get access to sealed sensitive parts of the plant Wednesday , after an IAEA surveillance system begins functioning . Helicopter gunships Saturday pounded militant hideouts in the Orakzai tribal region , where many Taliban militants are believed to have fled to avoid an earlier military offensive in nearby South Waziristan . They left after a tense hour-long standoff with riot police . U.N. relief coordinator Jan Egeland said Sunday , U.S. , Indonesian and Australian military helicopters are ferrying out food and supplies to remote areas of western Aceh province that ground crews can not reach . Mr. Egeland said the latest figures show 1.8 million people are in need of food assistance - with the need greatest in Indonesia , Sri Lanka , the Maldives and India . He said last week 's tsunami and the massive underwater earthquake that triggered it has affected millions in Asia and Africa . Some 1,27,000 people are known dead . Aid is being rushed to the region , but the U.N. official stressed that bottlenecks and a lack of infrastructure remain a challenge . Lebanese politicians are condemning Friday 's bomb blast in a Christian neighborhood of Beirut as an attempt to sow sectarian strife in the formerly war-torn country . In Beirut , a string of officials voiced their anger , while at the United Nations summit in New York , Prime Minister Fouad Siniora said the Lebanese people are resolute in preventing such attempts from destroying their spirit . One person was killed and more than 20 others injured in the bomb blast late Friday , which took place on a residential street . Lebanon has suffered a series of bombings since the massive explosion in February that killed former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and 20 other people . Syria is widely accused of involvement in his killing , and Friday 's explosion comes days before U.N. investigator Detlev Mehlis is to return to Damascus to interview several Syrian officials about the assassination . The global financial crisis has left Iceland 's economy in shambles . Israeli officials say Prime Minister Ariel Sharon will undergo a medical procedure Thursday to close a tiny hole in his heart discovered during treatment for a minor stroke suffered last month . Doctors describe the tiny hole as a minor birth defect and say it is in the partition between the upper chambers of Mr. Sharon 's heart . The procedure , known as cardiac catheterization , involves inserting a catheter through a blood vessel into the heart , where an umbrella-like device will plug the hole . Doctors say they expect Mr. Sharon will make a full recovery . Mr. Sharon returned to work on December 25 , one week after his emergency hospitalization . Doctors say the stroke has not caused any permanent damage . The designers of the first private manned rocket to burst into space have received a $ 10 million prize created to promote space tourism . SpaceShipOne designer Burt Rutan accepted the Ansari X Prize money and a trophy on behalf of his team Saturday during an awards ceremony in the U.S. state of Missouri . To win the money , SpaceShipOne had to blast off into space twice in a two-week period and fly at least 100 kilometers above Earth . The spacecraft made its flights in late September and early October , lifting off from California 's Mojave desert . Three major banks have collapsed , unemployment has soared , and the value of the krona has plunged . The vehicle had to carry a pilot and weight equivalent to two passengers . SpaceShipOne was financed with more than $ 20 million from Paul Allen , a co-founder of the Microsoft Corporation . North Korea says flooding caused by last week 's typhoon , Wipha , has destroyed 14,000 homes and 1,09,000 hectares of crops . The state news agency KCNA reported the damage Monday . It says the floods also destroyed or damaged 8,000 public buildings and washed out roads , bridges and railways . The report did not mention any deaths or injuries . Most of the heavy rains and flooding occurred in the southwestern part of the country , including the capital , Pyongyang . Last month , severe flooding in North Korea left 600 people dead or missing , and displaced more than 1,00,000 others . A strong earthquake under the ocean off Indonesia 's Sumatra and Nias islands has caused some panic but no damage or injuries . The U.S. Geological Survey gave a preliminary estimate of the strength of the Tuesday morning quake at 6.7 on the Richter scale , and said the epicenter was close to the island of Nias . Prime Minister Geir Haarde has refused to resign or call for early elections . The quake did not cause a tsunami . An earthquake in late March killed more than 900 people on Nias . Both Sumatra and Nias have experienced countless earthquakes since a massive tsunami-producing quake on December 26 . The latest official death toll from that tragedy stands at some 1,76,000 people killed - 1,28,000 of them in Indonesia . Nearly 50,000 people are still listed as missing , but most of them are feared dead . The U.S. rap star Snoop Dogg and five of his associates have been arrested in Britain after a disturbance at London 's Heathrow Airport . Police told British media that the musician , who was born with the name Calvin Broadus , and members of his entourage were being held on charges of \" violent disorder and affray . \" The group was waiting for a flight to South Africa , where Snoop Dogg was to perform in a concert Thursday , when it was denied access to a first-class lounge at the airport . Police said members of the group later threw bottles of whisky in a duty-free store and scuffled with police . Snoop Dogg is a former member of a street gang the Crips , from Southern California , and many of his songs reflect the gritty life on the streets . He blames Iceland 's economic calamity on commercial bankers . Afghan President Hamid Karzai says he has fired two \" high-ranking \" Afghan officials who were spying for other countries , and warns he would not spare anyone who engages in such activity . Mr. Karzai made the disclosure at a lunch meeting with newly sworn-in parliament members , and did not name the dismissed officials nor indicate when he took the action He also did not name the other countries involved . Mr. Karzai said he had strong evidence against the two officials . But he said even if he had minor evidence , he would have punished them . He said anyone found spying for foreign countries will be shown on television , and put on trial . Mr. Karzai has led Afghanistan since the Taleban were ousted in late 2001 . He won a presidential election in October 2004 . And now the Taleban are waging an insurgency against his administration . For the last four weeks a team led by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has been trying to broker a deal between the Kenyan government of President Mwai Kibaki and the opposition led by Raila Odinga . The negotiations have concentrated on a power sharing agreement and a transitional arrangement leading to new elections . The government was forced to ask the International Monetary Fund and several countries for a multi-billion-dollar loan . A recent report by the international crisis group says three complimentary sets of issues must be addressed to finalize a detailed power sharing agreement . Francois Grignon is director of the Africa program of the ICG . In a telephone interview to discuss the issues at stake , he told VOA reporter Akwei Thompson the opposition would demonstrate a stronger political will to tackle the task of legal and constitutional reform needed during the transition period because   the electoral dispute left them out , the losers  .  President Bush has signed legislation that will require screening of all air and sea cargo , and will provide more money to cities deemed to be at high risk of a terrorist attack . After signing the bill Friday and meeting with his advisers on counter-terrorism , Mr. Bush said his homeland security and counter-terrorism teams are doing everything they can to protect the country from what he called a \" dangerous enemy . \" The new measures carry out some recommendations made by the independent commission that investigated the September 11 , 2001 attacks on the United States . Those include a grant of $ 4 billion to be given to high-risk cities to upgrade transit security . They also mandate screening of all U.S.-bound cargo on planes and ships within the next five years . Burmese democracy advocate Aung San Suu Kyi is calling on citizens in her country to work toward national reconciliation in the new year . In a statement Friday , she asked the Burmese people to \" struggle together with new strengths , new force and new words \" in 2011 . Global health experts said cancer will become the leading cause of death in the world by 2010 , overtaking heart disease . The 65-year-old advocate for democratic reforms in Burma was released after more than seven years of house arrest on November 13 . That was just days after the country 's military rulers claimed an overwhelming victory in Burma 's widely criticized first election in two decades . She said in the statement that Burmese people need to establish political and social networks to achieve \" national reconciliation as well as a truly united spirit . \" The United States on Thursday again called for Burma 's leaders to free the more than 2,200 political prisoners in the country and engage in talks to promote democracy . Former U.S. President Bill Clinton has assembled world leaders , activists and academics in New York to address the issues of poverty , global warning and conflict . Opening Thursday , the Clinton Global Initiative 's conference coincides with the Millennium summit of the United Nations General Assembly . Mr. Clinton says the focus of the three-day conference is to secure concrete pledges from leaders to address significant problems , not to simply talk about them . Organizers say the conference is different from other forums because participants are required to pledge to address issues in concrete ways and to report back on their progress . Expected attendees or speakers include British Prime Minister Tony Blair , U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and Israel 's Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres . Peruvian election officials say the narrow gap between two candidates vying for the second spot on the ballot for the country 's run-off presidential election has tightened further . A World Health Organization report issued Tuesday said one factor behind cancer 's growing deadliness is rising cigarette smoking in developing countries . Officials said Sunday former center-left president Alan Garcia leads pro-business congresswoman Lourdes Flores by less than 96,000 votes , with nearly 90 percent of the votes counted . Garcia led Flores by nearly 1,10,000 votes on Saturday . The surge by Flores is attributed to heavy support among Peruvians living abroad whose votes are apparently starting to impact the election tally . Since no candidate received half of the vote in the April 9 election , a presidential run-off will be held 30 days after the final results are announced . Either Garcia or Flores will take on nationalist Ollanta Humala , who took 31 percent of the vote . Chilean authorities have freed on bail the wife and four adult children of former dictator Augusto Pinochet , a day after they were detained on tax evasion charges . Lucia Hiriart and her children were arrested Monday as part of an investigation into millions of dollars kept in bank accounts abroad . A fifth child , daughter Lucia , is also charged , but her whereabouts are unknown . If located , she will be prohibited from leaving the country . General Pinochet has been indicted for tax fraud for allegedly hiding $ 27 million in foreign bank accounts . 40 percent of the world 's smokers are thought to live in China and India alone . The former dictator also faces human rights charges related to his rule in the mid-1970s . His lawyers say he is not healthy enough to stand trial , but court-ordered doctors say he is fit enough to do so . Rebel sources in Mexico say a female leader of the Zapatista rebel movement has died . Zapatista leader Subcomandante Marcos Friday announced the death of Comandante Ramona , saying Mexico had lost a fighter and the Zapatistas had lost a piece of their heart . The announcement came during a stop in Chiapas , six days into the leader 's nationwide tour . The nature of Comandante Ramona 's death was not immediately clear , but it was rumored that she had cancer or a kidney disease . She had once received a kidney transplant . The mysterious female leader was a Tzotzil Indian and a promoter of women 's rights . She was a longtime member of the Zapatista movement and appeared in public wearing a black ski mask . On January 1 , Subcomandante Marcos emerged from his jungle hideout to begin a six-month nationwide tour in a bid to influence this year 's presidential elections . The WHO report said an estimated 12 million people will be diagnosed with some form of cancer this year . Representatives of the Washington-based Council on American-Islamic Relations have appealed for the release of kidnapped American journalist Jill Carroll . In Baghdad Saturday , an official with the influential Islamic group called on Carroll 's abductors to release her unharmed . In an earlier statement , the group said the 28-year-old journalist has a well-documented record of objective reporting and respect for both the Iraqi people and Arab-Islamic culture . There still is no word on the journalist 's fate , following a threat by her kidnappers to execute her Friday unless all eight female detainees in American custody in Iraq were released . Meanwhile , a militant group has kidnapped the son of a senior Iraqi Defense Ministry official . In a videotape shown on al-Arabiya ( Saturday ) , kidnappers threatened to kill the son of Brigadier-General Sabah Abd al-Karim unless Iraqi security forces stop cooperating with U.S.-led coalition troops in Iraq . Leading Muslim groups attending an anti-terrorism conference in northern India have denounced terrorism as \" un-Islamic . \" The declaration was made by thousands of scholars and clerics Monday at the country 's top Islamic seminary - the 150-year-old Darul-Uloom Deoband in Uttar Pradesh . Their statement said any terrorist activity targeting innocent people contradicts Islam 's concept of peace . It described Islam as a religion of mercy , and it condemned all kinds of oppression , violence and terrorism . The Pakistani military launched its offensive in Orakzai to hunt Taliban insurgents . It predicts that 7.6 million of them will die . However , the statement also called on the Indian government to ensure that members of the Muslim community are not harassed . It said that whenever there is a terrorist attack , attempts are made to link the attack to Muslims who have studied in madrassas or religious schools . The declaration also said many innocent Muslims are spending their lives behind bars , having been falsely accused of involvement in acts of terror . Microsoft founder Bill Gates and the government of Norway have pledged more than $ 1 billion for a campaign to vaccinate most of the world 's poorest children . Donors say they hope the $ 750 million grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and a pledge from Norway for $ 290 million spurs other foundations and governments to invest in The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization . The alliance hopes to immunize 90 percent of the world 's children by 2015 . The group estimates it will cost $ 8 to $ 12 billion . The World Health Organization estimates two million people die each year from diseases that are easily prevented by basic vaccines . Spain has begun a trial for 24 suspected al-Qaida members , including three accused of helping plan the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States . The defendants appeared in a Madrid court Friday , behind bulletproof glass . Health experts predicted the number of people who die from cancer will soon be greater than deaths from AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria combined . More than 100 armed police are providing security at a remodeled courtroom , specially-built for trials with multiple defendants . Among the accused is the suspected leader of the Spanish al-Qaida cell - Syrian-born Imad Eddin Barakat Yarkas . He allegedly organized a meeting of terror suspects in Spain during which details of the September 11 attacks were finalized . Prosecutors are asking that the leader of the group be sentenced to more than 60,000 years in prison if convicted . European Union observers are preparing to monitor Palestinian parliamentary elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip , despite recent kidnappings of foreigners . Chief EU observer Veronique De Keyser says her group is making regular security assessments and taking all necessary precautions . She says the EU 's commitment must be met , adding that it would a \" bad sign \" not to send monitors to Gaza , where several foreign aid workers were kidnapped and released unharmed in recent weeks . Ms. De Keyser spoke to reporters in Jerusalem Monday as more than 30 EU observers headed to Palestinian cities and towns . Campaigning for the January 25 elections begins Tuesday . But several senior Palestinian leaders are calling for a delay in the vote , citing dire law-and-order conditions and Israel 's refusal to permit voting in East Jerusalem . The WHO said the number of new cancer patients may rise to 27 million a year by 2030 , with 17 million people dying from the disease . An international delegation that monitored the elections in Liberia is calling on all concerned to act responsibly to ensure the post-war peace process stays on track . The delegation , led by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and former Benin President Nicephore Soglo , also urged the international community to continue its assistance . It added that extensive voter education will be needed if a runoff election is required . The delegation said a major problem in Tuesday 's poll was widespread lack of voter understanding of the process of casting ballots . It also cited voter ignorance of the nature of choice among the candidates . The joint delegation from the former U.S. president 's Carter Center and the National Democratic Institute includes representatives from 14 nations in Africa , Europe and North America . Afghan President Hamid Karzai has again called for reconciliation talks with Taleban militants . In remarks to people gathered at the main Shi'ite mosque in Kabul Monday , Mr. Karzai referred to what he called \" the enemy who wants our destruction and sheds our blood . \" He did not refer to the Taleban by name . The Afghan leader has made similar offers of talks before , but Taleban leaders have rebuffed them . A civil liberties group says it has obtained documents that allegedly show U.S. military forces tried to suppress reports about the abuse of Iraqi prisoners . Last year saw a dramatic increase in Taleban militant attacks against U.S. , NATO and Afghan forces in Afghanistan . At least four thousand people were killed in insurgency-related violence . U.S. and NATO military leaders in the country are warning of a new Taleban offensive in the coming months , as the snows thaw and mountain roads become more accessible . French police detained nine people Monday in the Paris region and nearby Normandy in a crackdown on a group suspected of planning terror attacks in France . At least seven of the suspects are believed to have links to an Algerian insurgency movement , the Salafist Group for Call and Combat , known as the GSPC , which has declared allegiance to al-Qaida . A detainee is escorted to interrogation by US military guards at Camp X-Ray at Guantanamo Bay US Naval Base The Pentagon says seven detainees at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba have been released to their home countries . A statement said Wednesday that three of the detainees were released after a tribunal determined that they were not enemy combatants . One was sent back to Sudan , another to Saudi Arabia and the third to Jordan . Four others cleared under different types of administrative review were released to Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan . The documents - released by the American Civil Liberties Union on Tuesday - say staff members of the Pentagon 's Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) witnessed several incidents of abuse , including prisoners being assaulted , deprived of sleep and humiliated . An eighth detainee , a Moroccan , has been transferred to Spain , where he is accused of having links to an al-Qaida cell . Yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue . Petroleum accounts for roughly 25 % of GDP and 70 % of government revenue . Yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment . In October 2009 , Yemen exported its first liquefied natural gas as part of this diversification effort . In January 2010 , the international community established the Friends of Yemen group that aims to support Yemen 's efforts towards economic and political reform , and in August 2010 the IMF approved a three-year $ 370 million program to further this effort . Despite these ambitious endeavors , Yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges , including declining water resources and a high population growth rate . Singapore was founded as a British trading colony in 1819 . It joined the Malaysian Federation in 1963 but separated two years later and became independent . Singapore subsequently became one of the world 's most prosperous countries with strong international trading links ( its port is one of the world 's busiest in terms of tonnage handled ) and with per capita GDP equal to that of the leading nations of Western Europe . The documents also included complaints that DIA personnel had their e-mails monitored by special forces , and were ordered \" not to talk to anyone in the U.S. \" about what they witnessed . Ruled by the Al Thani family since the mid-1800s , Qatar transformed itself from a poor British protectorate noted mainly for pearling into an independent state with significant oil and natural gas revenues . During the late 1980s and early 1990s , the Qatari economy was crippled by a continuous siphoning off of petroleum revenues by the Amir , who had ruled the country since 1972 . His son , the current Amir HAMAD bin Khalifa Al Thani , overthrew him in a bloodless coup in 1995 . In 2001 , Qatar resolved its longstanding border disputes with both Bahrain and Saudi Arabia . As of 2007 , oil and natural gas revenues had enabled Qatar to attain the second-highest per capita income in the world . Subsistence agriculture , together with forestry , remains the backbone of the economy of the Central African Republic ( CAR ) , with about 60 % of the population living in outlying areas . The agricultural sector generates more than half of GDP . Timber has accounted for about 16 % of export earnings and the diamond industry , for 40 % . Important constraints to economic development include the CAR 's landlocked position , a poor transportation system , a largely unskilled work force , and a legacy of misdirected macroeconomic policies . Factional fighting between the government and its opponents remains a drag on economic revitalization . The ACLU obtained the documents after a federal court ordered the Pentagon to comply with a year-old request under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act . Distribution of income is extraordinarily unequal . Grants from France and the international community can only partially meet humanitarian needs . A PEASANT found an Eagle captured in a trap , and much admiring the bird , set him free . The Eagle did not prove ungrateful to his deliverer , for seeing the Peasant sitting under a wall which was not safe , he flew toward him and with his talons snatched a bundle from his head . When the Peasant rose in pursuit , the Eagle let the bundle fall again . Taking it up , the man returned to the same place , to find that the wall under which he had been sitting had fallen to pieces ; and he marveled at the service rendered him by the Eagle . THE ASS and the Fox , having entered into partnership together for their mutual protection , went out into the forest to hunt . They had not proceeded far when they met a Lion . The Fox , seeing imminent danger , approached the Lion and promised to contrive for him the capture of the Ass if the Lion would pledge his word not to harm the Fox . Then , upon assuring the Ass that he would not be injured , the Fox led him to a deep pit and arranged that he should fall into it . Georgian Prime Minister Zurab Zhvania says he supports democracy in Ukraine and hopes the upcoming Ukrainian presidential election will be free and fair . The Lion , seeing that the Ass was secured , immediately clutched the Fox , and attacked the Ass at his leisure . Never trust your enemy Old mathematicians never die ; they just lose some of their functions . Nostalgia is like a grammar lesson . You find the present tense and the past perfect . My grandfather worked in a blacksmith shop when he was a boy , and he used to tell me how he had toughened himself up so he could stand the rigors of blacksmithing . He said he would stand outside behind the house and , with a 5 pound potato sack in each hand , extend his arms straight out to his sides and hold them there as long as he could . After a while he tried 10 pound potato sacks , then 20 pound potato sacks and finally he got to where he could lift a 50 pound potato sack in each hand and hold his arms straight out for five full minutes ! Eventually , he even started putting potatoes in the sacks . Advance copies of the United Nations ' internal audit of its oil-for-food program reportedly show that U.N. officials wasted money and overlooked massive overcharges by contractors . News reports published Sunday in the United States say the audits , part of an extensive independent report to be released on Monday , criticize a former top aide to Secretary-General Kofi Annan , Benon Sevan , and the U.N. office he headed that ran the oil-for-food program . Mr. Zhvania , who is currently visiting the United States , made the comment Wednesday in an interview with the Voice of America . However , the advance portions of the audit described by The New York Times and Associated Press do not reveal any systematic corruption or bribery . Mr. Annan named an independent panel to investigate the program following allegations that billions of dollars were diverted by some members of the former Saddam Hussein regime and other corrupt officials . The program was created in 1996 to help the people of Iraq after the first Gulf War . Former U.S. central bank chief Paul Volcker heads the independent commission . He said last week that no clear-cut evidence of wrongdoing has been found . Sri Lanka 's military says it has launched airstrikes on rebel sites in northern parts of the country , following rebel artillery attacks . Officials Saturday said at least 11 soldiers were killed and 53 others were wounded in the fighting on the Jaffna peninsula . They said Tamil Tiger rebels provoked the fighting by opening fire with artillery strikes against Sri Lankan troops . Government officials also said they sent a naval ship to the peninsula to evacuate nearly 800 civilians trapped in the area . Thousands of people have been stranded in northern Sri Lanka since rebels launched new attacks last month . He also expressed satisfaction with his U.S. visit , which began Sunday , and says the United States has a great deal of interest in Georgia . The Tamil Tiger rebels have been fighting for a separate homeland in the north and east since the early 1980s . Tens of thousands of people have died in the violence . The White House will become a pink house on Thursday , as it is bathed in pink lighting to call attention to the fight against breast cancer . U.S. President Barack Obama announced on the social networking site Twitter that the executive mansion will be lit in pink Thursday evening in recognition of October as National Breast Cancer Awareness Month . Earlier this month , Mr. Obama signed a proclamation for breast cancer awareness month . It is one of numerous public efforts in October in the U.S. aimed at fighting the disease . Last year , a large pink ribbon was hung outside the White House . The American Cancer Society says there are about 40,000 breast cancer deaths annually in the U.S. The World Health Organization says breast cancer claims 5,19,000 lives worldwide each year . Someone in the world dies in a traffic accident , on average , every 30 seconds . So far , nearly 100 militants have been reported killed in the region since Thursday . Mr. Zhvania has met with a number of high-level U.S. officials , including National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice .

Although explored by the Spanish early in the 16th century , initial attempts at colonizing Costa Rica proved unsuccessful due to a combination of factors , including : disease from mosquito-infested swamps , brutal heat , resistance by natives , and pirate raids . It was not until 1563 that a permanent settlement of Cartago was established in the cooler , fertile central highlands . The area remained a colony for some two and a half centuries . In 1821 , Costa Rica became one of several Central American provinces that jointly declared their independence from Spain . Two years later it joined the United Provinces of Central America , but this federation disintegrated in 1838 , at which time Costa Rica proclaimed its sovereignty and independence . Since the late 19th century , only two brief periods of violence have marred the country 's democratic development . In 1949 , Costa Rica dissolved its armed forces .

In the tape , Zarqawi accuses their highest religious authority , Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani , of approving November 's U.S.-led invasion to crush insurgents hiding in the Sunni stronghold of Fallujah . He also accuses Shi'ites of killing innocents in Fallujah , and claims they fought alongside 800 Israeli soldiers as well as Jordanian troops . The authenticity of the tape has not been established . Many of Fallujah 's residents fled ahead of November 's offensive . The U.S. military said Thursday that the city is now completely reopened and a little more than half of its residents have returned . Ceremonies in the U.S. have marked the anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks with moments of silence and the reading of victims ' names . Bells tolled and bagpipes played in New York at the moment eight years ago when the first of two hijacked airliners slammed into the World Trade Center . The latest fighting raged despite a cease-fire offered by the rebels to take place during a regional summit in the capital , Colombo . President Barack Obama took part in a ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House , while Vice President Joe Biden spoke at the service in New York . Nearly 3,000 people died on September 11 , 2001 , in a coordinated al-Qaeda attack involving four hijacked planes . One of them crashed into the Pentagon , where Mr. Obama plans to attend a wreathlaying on Friday . Services are also planned in Shanksville , Pennsylvania , the crash site of United Airlines Flight 93 . That aircraft went down after passengers fought hijackers and presumably stopped the plane from hitting its intended target . Witnesses in Nepal say police have opened fire on a protest rally against King Gyanendra in the west of the country , wounding at least one person . They say the incident took place Thursday in the town of Pokhara , as police tried to disperse the demonstrators . The protest coincided with a nationwide strike called by opposition parties to protest the king 's plan for municipal elections . The streets of the capital , Kathmandu , were deserted , and schools and businesses were closed around the country . Riot police were patrolling to prevent the violence that has accompanied previous strikes . The rebels have been fighting for an independent homeland for ethnic Tamils in Sri Lanka 's north and east since 1983 . The strike is aimed at stopping candidates from registering for February 8 elections , a process that began today . Only a few candidates filed their nominations in Kathmandu in the first few hours . The alliance of seven opposition groups says it will boycott the vote , because it would legitimize the king 's absolute rule . A Russian newspaper says Russia is planning to sell up to nine submarines to Venezuela . The Kommersant reports Thursday that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is expected to sign the deal during a trip to Moscow , which starts June 29 . The contract would include five older , 636-type diesel submarines and the future delivery of four state-of-the-art 677 Amur submarines . Russia has also supplied similar submarines to China . In recent years , Venezuela has become a major buyer of Russian arms , a development that has prompted expressions of concern by the United States . Previous Russian arms deals have supplied Venezuela with Kalashnikov rifles , jets , helicopters , and other weaponry . Venezuela 's president is a fierce critic of the Bush administration and says it supported the coup against him in April 2002 . They complain of discrimination by the ethnic Sinhalese majority . U.S. officials have denied the charge . U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney has arrived in Saudi Arabia for talks on issues including how to stop the sectarian violence in Iraq . Cheney is expected to ask Saudi officials to use their influence with Iraq 's Sunni Arab minority to help stabilize the country . U.S. officials say the Saudi government has been a strong ally in the region . The vice president 's talks with King Abdullah also will include the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the situation in Lebanon . On Wednesday , President Bush is to open talks about Iraqi security with Iraq 's Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in Jordan . The Bush administration is reviewing its strategy in Iraq in hopes of stopping the rise in sectarian violence and continued attacks on coalition forces . A new law comes into effect in Brazil Sunday , allowing the country 's air force to shoot down planes suspected of smuggling drugs . Drug traffickers frequently fly over Brazil while smuggling drugs from neighboring Colombia . Bogota also has a similar shoot-down policy . President Bush has signed legislation reaffirming U.S. support for the continued expansion of NATO . Brazilian officials say air force pilots must follow an eight-step procedure before shooting at a suspected drug plane . Critics say that despite those steps , the chance of human error remains and innocent people could be killed . Such a mistake occurred in Peru in 2001 , and an American missionary and her child were killed . Israel has formally turned over the West Bank city of Jericho to Palestinian forces . Israeli troops took down their national flag and dismantled a key checkpoint as Palestinian forces took up positions inside the city . Top commanders from both sides resolved a last-minute hitch over paperwork and signed an agreement to formalize the transfer . Israel still controls two checkpoints outside Jericho , but troops have relaxed security procedures to ease travel to the city . Jericho is the first of five towns ( with Tulkarem , Qalqiliya , Ramallah , Bethlehem ) that Israel plans to turn over to Palestinian control . Meanwhile , Israeli television reported that Jewish extremists plan to take over a disputed holy site in Jerusalem to try to sabotage Israel 's planned withdrawal from Gaza . Also Wednesday in Cairo , Egyptian and Palestinian officials and Palestinian militant leaders are discussing a proposed one-year halt to Palestinian attacks on Israeli targets . The measure designates Albania , Croatia , Georgia , Macedonia and Ukraine as eligible to receive financial assistance as they pursue NATO membership . Afghan officials say three police officers have been killed in two different suicide bombings Tuesday . Authorities say one officer was killed when a bomber rammed a police car in the southern province of Paktika , near the border with Pakistan . They say the other bombing took place in the relatively quiet province of Kunduz , when a bomber detonated his car while being followed by police . That blast killed two policemen . Separately , government officials said unidentified gunmen kidnapped two workers from the ministry of rural development . That abduction occurred Monday in the western province of Nimroz . A Seoul-based human rights group says North Korea has executed 70 defectors who were captured in China and repatriated . The private Commission to Help North Korean Refugees cited informants in the North as saying the executions were carried out to set an example for others thinking about fleeing . The group said in a statement Friday that eight or nine defectors were executed last month in public to discourage other people from fleeing to China . South Korean officials have not confirmed the report . It also specifies that funds for military assistance for these countries should be included in next year 's budget . China is North Korea 's only important ally and by treaty returns North Koreans , who Beijing regards as illegal immigrants and not as refugees . More than 1,00,000 North Koreans are believed to be hiding in China . NATO says its forces carried out a precision airstrike Saturday targeting a Taleban militant in southern Afghanistan . In a statement , NATO said the mission targeted the vehicle of a suspected terrorist who is allegedly linked to the transport of anti-aircraft weapons . Details about casualties related to the strike in Helmand province were not released . The strike took place during the first week of NATO 's offensive against Taleban militants in southern Afghanistan . Also Saturday , authorities in eastern Afghanistan say four Afghan security officers were killed in a roadside bomb blast . Officials say the attack occurred in Khost province , near the Pakistani border . In southern Afghanistan Friday , a remote-controlled bomb ripped through the vehicle of pro-government tribal elder Mullah Naqib . Naqib and some of his family members and guards were wounded in the blast and at least two others were killed . Separately , officials say four British soldiers from the NATO-led peacekeeping mission were wounded early Saturday in an attack in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif . But the White House announcement did not specify a figure . Russian President Vladimir Putin has arrived in the Hague for the EuropeanUnion-Russian Summit Thursday where the disputed Ukrainian presidential election is expected to top the agenda . EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso has said the 25-member bloc will make it clear to the Russian President that the EU is not \" satisfied \" with Ukraine 's disputed election . Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych -- who was backed by Mr. Putin -- has been declared the winner of Sunday 's voting , but the EU is rejecting the results because of allegations of widespread voting fraud . On other issues , EU leaders say they will call on Russia to sign and ratify border agreements with Estonia and Latvia , and urge it to seek a political settlement in war-torn Chechnya . Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has fired three top security officials after militants broke the ceasefire he reached with Israel and fired mortars at Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip . Mr. Abbas dismissed the men , including security chief Abdel Razek Majaidie , hours after Hamas militants fired the mortars . No one was wounded in the shelling , which Hamas said was a response to Israeli gunfire that killed a Palestinian man Wednesday in Gaza . Despite the violence , Israeli and Palestinian officials met late Thursday to discuss security issues . Meanwhile , a deadly shootout was also reported at a Palestinian jail in Gaza City . Palestinian sources say at least three people described as Israeli collaborators were killed when dozens of masked gunmen stormed a jailhouse and set free several prisoners . Al-Qaida 's deputy leader , Ayman al-Zawahiri , has warned that the Persian Gulf region and Israel will be the terrorist group 's next targets . Germany , France and Lithuania are the latest European countries to congratulate Viktor Yushchenko on his victory in the Ukrainian presidential election . In a letter to Mr. Yushchenko Tuesday , German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder expressed optimism that Ukraine will continue what he called its transition toward the rule of law and a market economy . Lithuanian President Viktor Adamkus congratulated Mr. Yushchenko in a telephone conversation . In Paris , the foreign ministry said France and its European Union partners are determined to support democracy and modernization in Ukraine . Meanwhile , Russia has questioned the objectivity of monitors for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe . That organization characterized last month 's presidential election re-run as flawed , while saying that Sunday 's poll vastly improved upon the last vote . Russia backed Mr. Yushchenko 's opponent . U.S. weather forecasters say Tropical Storm Ernesto has formed over the Caribbean and is heading toward Jamaica and the Cayman Islands . The National Hurricane Center thinks the storm could strengthen in coming days and is on track to enter the Gulf of Mexico next week . The center is urging Jamaica and the Cayman Islands to monitor the threats posed by Ernesto , the fifth named storm of the season . The Egyptian-born Zawahiri issued the threat in a videotaped message that was broadcast Monday - the fifth anniversary of the September 11 attacks on the United States . Earlier Friday , Tropical Storm Debby weakened over the Atlantic . The National Hurricane Center in Miami says Debby is about 2,200 kilometers northwest of the Cape Verde Islands , with winds near 65 kilometers per hour . It says no significant change in strength is expected over the next day . Ethiopian security forces say they have foiled what they describe as a terrorist plot by a group linked to the country 's main opposition party . A statement released through state media says authorities arrested a group that was planning attacks in the capital , Addis Ababa . The statement says the group planned to target government officials and institutions . Ethiopian authorities say they also seized bombs , explosives and small arms related to the plot . The statement did not say how many people were arrested or explain how the alleged group is linked to the opposition Coalition for Unity and Democracy . Leaders of the party were not available for comment . Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi has repeatedly accused the opposition of conspiring to incite violence and seeking to overthrow him . Zawahiri warned of \" new events \" and suggested that militants should target Western economic interests . The government has charged at least 129 opposition leaders , journalists and others with treason and planning to commit genocide . United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has ordered disciplinary action against senior U.N. officials who worked on the oil-for-food program in Iraq . Mr. Annan said in a statement Thursday a report about alleged corruption in the U.N. program has turned up \" extremely troubling evidence of wrongdoing , \" and he pledged that no one involved would be shielded from prosecution . The independent report , released Thursday , concluded that the head of the oil-for-food program , Benon Sevan , seriously undermined the integrity of the United Nations by his conduct . U.N. disciplinary proceedings have begun against Mr. Sevan and another senior official , Joseph Stephanides . Both Mr. Sevan and Mr. Stephanides are Cypriot nationals . Critics say billions of dollars were siphoned away from the oil-for-food program , which was devised after the first Gulf War in an attempt to help Iraq 's impoverished civilian population . Rebels and government forces in Ivory Coast began withdrawing heavy weapons from the front line Thursday , complying with a new peace deal to end tensions in the divided nation . The pullback , expected to last four days , includes all guns larger than 20 millimeters and short-range weaponry equal to or larger than 60 millimeters , including mortars . Anti-tank weapons will remain in place . The deputy-leader also accused Western powers of stealing \" Muslim \" oil . One rebel fighter told VOA he was happy to see the repeatedly postponed disarmament process begin , adding that he hopes to become a police officer once the two-year-old conflict is finally over . Several peace deals have failed to take hold in Ivory Coast . Rebels still hold huge swaths of territory in northern and western Ivory Coast , with the government firmly in control of the south . News reports from Uzbekistan say sporadic gunfire has continued in areas along the Kyrgyz border , following Friday 's military crackdown against protesters in the city of Andijan . The Associated Press quoted residents as saying several soldiers and civilians were killed when clashes erupted Sunday in two border villages , Teshiktosh and Karasu . Earlier reports said as many as 500 people were killed when security forces fired into a crowd of demonstrators in Andijan on Friday . But Uzbek President Islam Karimov said the death toll was much lower . He blamed the bloodshed on Islamic radicals trying to overthrow the government . Several countries , including the United States , have called for restraint . British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw called the Andijan crackdown a clear abuse of human rights . Zawahiri stressed that Western leaders should be more concerned about attacks in the Gulf or Israel than violence in Iraq or Afghanistan . Pope John Paul II has included prayers for the victims of the Asian tsunami in his New Year 's Day Mass marking the Roman Catholic Church 's annual World Day of Peace . Thousands of pilgrims attended the Pope 's outdoor Mass Saturday at the Vatican . John Paul II also led a Mass for the tsunami victims in his private chapel overnight . In his peace message , the pontiff called for greater cooperation among the world 's religions , and for promotion of peace through dialogue , justice and forgiveness . He urged the world 's one billion Roman Catholics to , \" win the fight over evil with the armies of love . \" The European Union opened membership talks with Turkey early Tuesday , after settling last-minute objections by Austria . EU foreign ministers ended 30 hours of heated emergency meetings late Monday in Luxembourg with Austrian officials withdrawing Vienna 's demand that the EU retain the option of offering Turkey a limited partnership . Turkey had rejected the option . Austria 's cooperation paved the way for all 25 EU member-states to agree on a negotiating framework for the membership process , which is expected to take about 10 years . A brief ceremony to officially open the talks took place shortly after midnight Tuesday in Luxembourg . He also made the first indirect threat against United Nations peacekeepers bound for Lebanon . Talks had been scheduled to open Monday . If accepted , Turkey would be the first country with a majority Muslim population to join the European Union . It has been an associate member of the bloc since 1963 . Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has called for both his supporters and opponents to work with him as he embarks on his fifth presidential term .

He also promised November 's legislative elections will be \" free and fair , \" after criticisms that September 's first multi-candidate presidential race was rife with voting irregularities . Mr. Mubarak beat nine challengers , winning more than 88 percent of the vote . Japan says it wants safety guarantees for its players and fans when its national soccer ( football ) team travels to North Korea for a World Cup qualifying match in June . Japan 's Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroyuki Hosoda says it is a necessary precondition for any international match that players can play safely and spectators can be protected . Zawahiri said the force is \" hostile to Islam . \" Japanese concerns were raised by scenes of mob violence at a match in Pyongyang between Iran and North Korea on Wednesday . The game was televised and cameras showed the North Korean spectators throwing bottles , cans and seats at players and officials on the field . Riot police had to clear a path for the victorious Iranian players to reach their team bus . The violence at the game was a rare occurrence in the tightly controlled North Korean state . A published report says the United States has been flying drones over Iran for almost a year , looking for evidence of nuclear weapons programs and detect weaknesses in air defenses . In Sunday 's editions , The Washington Post quotes three U.S. officials as saying the U.S. military has been launching the unmanned surveillance flights from Iraq . There has been no U.S. comment on the report . An Iranian spokesman Sunday again warned the United States not to attack its nuclear facilities . He also rejected a European proposal aimed at restricting Tehran 's development of nuclear fuel . Iran has said in the past it would stop plans to build a heavy water nuclear reactor , which can be used to make nuclear weapons-grade material as well as for nuclear energy . The message was not dated , but Zawahiri referred to the war between Israel and Hezbollah guerrillas . But Sunday in Tehran , a foreign ministry spokesman said Iran will go forward with the heavy water reactor and will not replace it under any circumstances . North Korea says its Catholic community has organized religious services in memory of Pope John Paul . The official news agency , KCNA , on Tuesday quotes Samuel Jang Jae On , described as head of the country 's Catholic association , as saying North Korean Catholics are deeply saddened by the pontiff 's passing . The agency says Mr. Jang sent the Vatican a message of condolence . North Korea is widely described as one of the world 's most repressive political regimes . It is not clear how many Catholics live in the Communist nation and to what extent they can practice their religion . Thousands of protesters have demonstrated outside a Philippine army camp , where U.S. soldiers and Philippine troops have begun joint military exercises . Demonstrators in the town of Carmen on the southern island of Mindanao chanted anti-U.S. slogans Tuesday and demanded that American troops leave the area . U.S. soldiers will also take part in the Philippines ' annual war games , to be held next month on Jolo island in the southern Philippines . Jolo is where the al-Qaida-linked militant group Abu Sayyaf has carried out bombings , kidnappings and killings of foreigners in recent years . An animal rights group says more than 40 dolphins are being held under what it calls \" appalling \" conditions in the Solomon Islands . Philippine law prohibits American troops from joining any combat operations with Philippine forces . Security for the war games will be tight , to protect the soldiers from attacks by rebels . In addition to military training , troops will carry out humanitarian missions to try to boost support among Jolo 's residents . The U.N. World Food Program is giving emergency assistance to the Cuban government . The WFP announced Tuesday that it will help feed about two million people at a cost of nearly $ 6 million . The aid package is intended to help Cuba recover from last month 's devastation from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike . During the next six months , WFP will provide food rations , including rice , beans , vegetable oil , canned fish and more . The WFP will also supply temporary food storage warehouses and liquid gas stoves to people who lost their cooking facilities in the storms . Sweden 's Nobel Foundation begins announcing winners of the annual Nobel Prize awards on Monday in Oslo , Norway . Prizes for medicine , physics , chemistry and literature will be announced before the prestigious Peace Prize is revealed Friday . It was not immediately clear what motivated the attack . The World Society for the Protection of Animals says the dolphins are being kept in cages in overcrowded , shallow and polluted pens off the island of Gavutu in the Pacific island nation . A separate prize for economics will be announced October 10 . It was instituted in 1968 by the Bank of Sweden in memory of the founder of the Nobel Prize , Swedish philanthropist Alfred Nobel . Winners receive their awards , including a check worth $ 1.3 million , at a banquet on December 10 . That is the anniversary of Mr. Nobel 's death in 1896 . According to his will , a five-member committee elected by the Norwegian parliament chooses the Peace Prize laureate , while Swedish scientific and literary groups choose the other winners . The first Nobel Prizes were given in 1901 . Insurgents in Iraq fired a barrage of mortar rounds into central Baghdad Thursday , killing at least one person and wounding several others . Police say some of the mortars landed in the Green Zone -- the heavily fortified enclave that houses Iraqi government offices and several foreign embassies . Last week , a mortar attack on the Green Zone killed four employees of a British security company . The group says the dolphins suffer from cuts , scratches and sunburn , and appear to be undernourished and stressed . Meanwhile , the U.S. military is planning to temporarily increase the number of American troops in Iraq to bolster security ahead of Iraq 's January election . The Defense Department said Wednesday the size of U.S. forces in Iraq will increase to 1,50,000 from its current level of 1,38,000 . Iraq 's interim government has rejected calls from some Sunni parties to postpone the vote because of security concerns . Brazilian lawmakers have approved legislation that will give the government more control over developing offshore oil fields . The lower house of the Brazilian congress passed the bill Wednesday , sending it to outgoing President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva for his signature . The measure allows the state-owned oil company , known as Petrobras , to be the sole operator of unexplored offshore oil fields , as well as a 30 percent stake in any joint ventures . Brazil has discovered potentially large oil reserves off the country 's southeastern coast , some of them thousands of meters below the sea floor . Some estimates say the fields may contain more than 50 billion barrels of oil . Brazilian lawmakers also approved a provision that will allow non-oil producing states to receive more oil revenues . A new U.S. opinion survey shows eight out of 10 Americans believe the country is going in the wrong direction . The group urged the Solomon Islands to rehabilitate and release the dolphins into the wild . The Washington Post-ABC News poll also indicates Democrats hold a 21 percentage point advantage over Republicans as the party better equipped to handle the country 's problems . In a hypothetical general election match-up , Democratic Party candidate Senator Barack Obama leads presumed Republican nominee John McCain by 51-to-44 percent . As the Democratic Party nears the end of its presidential primaries , the national poll shows Obama has a 12-point advantage over Senator Hillary Clinton as the party 's choice for its nomination . The poll says Americans cite the economy and employment as their top voting issue , followed by the Iraq war , healthcare and fuel prices . The poll of more than 1,100 adults , conducted from May 8 - 11 , has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points . Cuban President Raul Castro is visiting Venezuela on his first international trip as leader of the communist nation . Venezuela 's socialist president , Hugo Chavez , welcomed Mr. Castro Saturday at the Caracas airport . This is President Castro 's first official foreign trip since February , when the 77-year-old took charge from his ailing older brother , Fidel Castro . The two leaders will visit the tomb of South American independence icon Simon Bolivar today and later hold talks on a variety of issues . Venezuela and Cuba have increased cooperation on energy and oil production . Last year , 28 dolphins were transported by plane from the Solomon Islands to Mexico , sparking international criticism . Venezuela is a critical trade partner for the Caribbean island nation , which imports nearly 1,00,000 barrels of oil per day from Venezuela . Today 's visit comes ahead of a summit in Brazil next week , where Latin American and Caribbean leaders will gather for talks . The nuclear cooperation pact between India and the United States has sparked a mixed reaction in Washington and abroad . International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Mohamed ElBaradei praised the agreement , saying it would bring India closer as an important partner in the non-proliferation group of countries . But some U.S. lawmakers criticized the deal , saying the agreement that could give India access to U.S. civilian nuclear technology would undermine the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . India has not signed the treaty , which restricts the sharing of some nuclear technology with non-member nations , and drew widespread international criticism for conducting nuclear weapons tests as recently as 1998 . Full details of the nuclear cooperation pact have not been released , but the agreement must still be approved by Congress before taking effect . President Bush acknowledged Thursday that hard work still needs to be done to gain the necessary approval in Congress . A Sudanese analyst says the late rebel leader John Garang was a symbol of the struggle for greater federalism in the country . Lecturer John Gai Yoh of the University of South Africa ( UNISA ) in Pretoria credits the leader of the Sudanese Liberation Movement with creating a campaign that included allies beyond his base in the south . A reporters ' advocacy group has condemned the shutdown of a Somali radio station and the detention of two of its reporters . Mr. Yoh notes that his vision materialized with the comprehensive peace agreement signed last January between the former SPLA rebels and the government in Khartoum . Analyst John Gai Yoh predicts that the SPLA will continue to democratize : it has created a new SPLA parliament for the south and has named a new five-man military panel to lead the movement . The United Nations has given its annual Franklin Delano Roosevelt International Disability Award to Poland , recognizing the country 's efforts to integrate the disabled into Polish society . President Lech Kaczynski accepted the award at a ceremony Monday at U.N. headquarters in New York . He said his country 's struggle for freedom includes a commitment to the rights of those with disabilities . He said their rights are guaranteed by the Polish constitution . Mr. Kaczynski promised that Poland will adopt a new U.N. convention to protect the disabled . The award is named for U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt , whose legs were paralyzed from polio . Mr. Roosevelt was president from 1933 until 1945 . An Ethiopian government spokesman denies that a reported rebel attack said to have killed 140 soldiers ever took place . The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists says it is alarmed by the closure of Radio Shabelle in the city of Baidoa on Sunday . The spokesman , Zemedkun Tekle , issued the denial Sunday after media reports said the Ogaden National Liberation Front had claimed to have carried out the deadly attack Saturday in southeastern Ethiopia near Wardheer . A purported statement from the group received by some news organizations said about a thousand rebels took part in the attack and seized ammunition along with military hardware . The government spokesman says there was no attack , and that the rebel group is not in a position to carry out such an attack . Rebels have been fighting for more autonomy for ethnic Somalis in the eastern region of Ogaden bordering Somalia . Kuwaiti television reports the kidnappers in Iraq of American journalist Jill Carroll are threatening to kill her if their demands are not met by February 26 . Al-Rai television Friday quoted sources close to the kidnappers as saying the abductors have set the deadline . The militants holding Carroll previously had demanded that all Iraqi women prisoners be freed . Earlier Friday , at least eight people died and more than 20 were wounded in a Baghdad car bombing near a Sunni Muslim mosque . Officials in Iraq also certified results of the December 15 elections , confirming the near majority of parliament seats won by Shi'ite religious parties . According to the results , the dominant Shi'ite coalition , the United Iraqi Alliance , won 128 seats in the 275-member parliament . Somalia 's transitional government shut down the station after it broadcast a report saying 300 Ethiopian soldiers had crossed into Somalia . Palestinian security officials say masked Palestinian police briefly stormed a government building in the Gaza Strip in anger over not receiving their salaries from the Hamas-led government . Security officials say about 50 police officers sealed off the main road Saturday in the central Gaza town of Khan Younis . They say the masked police surrounded a municipal government building , taking positions on the roof and firing in the air . The protest is seen as a sign of discontent with the new Hamas-led government , which took office late last month . The cash-strapped Palestinian Authority has not been able to pay salaries to some 1,40,000 government employees since March . Western nations have cut off aid to the Palestinian government , demanding that Hamas renounce violence and recognize Israel . The White House said President Bush has approved duty-free treatment for imports of certain types of watches that are n't produced in \" significant quantities \" in the U.S. , the Virgin Islands and other U.S. possessions . The action came in response to a petition filed by Timex Inc. for changes in the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences for imports from developing nations . Previously , watch imports were denied such duty-free treatment . Timex had requested duty-free treatment for many types of watches , covered by 58 different U.S. tariff classifications . Ethiopia has denied the report . The White House said Mr. Bush decided to grant duty-free status for 18 categories , but turned down such treatment for other types of watches \" because of the potential for material injury to watch producers located in the U.S. and the Virgin Islands . \" Timex is a major U.S. producer and seller of watches , including low-priced battery-operated watches assembled in the Philippines and other developing nations covered by the U.S. tariff preferences . U.S. trade officials said the Philippines and Thailand would be the main beneficiaries of the president 's action . Imports of the types of watches that now will be eligible for duty-free treatment totaled about $ 37.3 million in 1988 , a relatively small share of the $ 1.5 billion in U.S. watch imports that year , according to an aide to U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills . Although known to Arab and Malay sailors as early as the 10th century , Mauritius was first explored by the Portuguese in the 16th century and subsequently settled by the Dutch - who named it in honor of Prince Maurits van NASSAU - in the 17th century . The French assumed control in 1715 , developing the island into an important naval base overseeing Indian Ocean trade , and establishing a plantation economy of sugar cane . The British captured the island in 1810 , during the Napoleonic Wars . Mauritius remained a strategically important British naval base , and later an air station , playing an important role during World War II for anti-submarine and convoy operations , as well as the collection of signals intelligence . Independence from the UK was attained in 1968 . A stable democracy with regular free elections and a positive human rights record , the country has attracted considerable foreign investment and has earned one of Africa 's highest per capita incomes . The advocacy group quotes Radio Shabelle 's deputy director Mohamed Amiin as saying militiamen entered its premises and detained the two journalists , Mohamed Adawe and Ali Mohamed Saed , for about eight hours . Recent poor weather , declining sugar prices , and declining textile and apparel production , have slowed economic growth , leading to some protests over standards of living in the Creole community . Morocco 's market economy benefits from the country 's relatively low labor costs and proximity to Europe , which aid key areas of the economy such as agriculture , light manufacturing , tourism , and remittances . Morocco is also the world 's largest exporter of phosphate , which has long provided a source of export earnings and economic stability . Economic policies pursued since 2003 by King MOHAMMED VI have brought macroeconomic stability to the country with generally low inflation , improved financial performance , and steady progress in developing the service and industrial sectors . In 2006 , Morocco entered a Free Trade Agreement ( FTA ) with the US , and in 2008 entered into an advanced status in its 2000 Association Agreement with the EU . However , poverty , illiteracy , and unemployment rates remain high . In response to these challenges , King MOHAMMED in 2005 launched a National Initiative for Human Development , a $ 2 billion program aimed at alleviating poverty and underdevelopment by expanding electricity to rural areas and replacing urban slums with public and subsidized housing , among other policies . Morocco 's trade and budget deficits widened in 2010 , and reducing government spending and adapting to sluggish economic growth in Europe will be challenges in 2011 . Morocco 's long-term challenges include improving education and job prospects for young Moroccans , closing the disparity in wealth between the rich and the poor , confronting corruption , and expanding and diversifying exports beyond phosphates and low-value-added products . Albania , a formerly closed , centrally-planned state , is making the difficult transition to a more modern open-market economy . It says the government gave no explanation for its action . Macroeconomic growth averaged around 6 % between 2004 - 8 , but declined to about 3 % in 2009 - 10 . Inflation is low and stable . The government has taken measures to curb violent crime , and recently adopted a fiscal reform package aimed at reducing the large gray economy and attracting foreign investment . Remittances , a significant catalyst for economic growth have declined from Dec-15 % of GDP to 9 % of GDP in 2009 , mostly from Albanians residing in Greece and Italy ; this helps offset the towering trade deficit . The agricultural sector , which accounts for almost half of employment but only about one-fifth of GDP , is limited primarily to small family operations and subsistence farming because of lack of modern equipment , unclear property rights , and the prevalence of small , inefficient plots of land . Energy shortages because of a reliance on hydropower , and antiquated and inadequate infrastructure contribute to Albania 's poor business environment and lack of success in attracting new foreign investment needed to expand the country 's export base . FDI is among the lowest in the region , but the government has embarked on an ambitious program to improve the business climate through fiscal and legislative reforms . The completion of a new thermal power plant near Vlore has helped diversify generation capacity , and plans to upgrade transmission lines between Albania and Montenegro and Kosovo would help relieve the energy shortages . Also , with help from EU funds , the government is taking steps to improve the poor national road and rail network , a long-standing barrier to sustained economic growth . Economic activity consists primarily of subsistence farming and fishing . Taleban rebels are not known to operate in northern Afghanistan and the area has been spared much of the bloodshed that has plagued southern and eastern regions . The station remained off the air on Monday . The islands have few mineral deposits worth exploiting , except for high-grade phosphate . The potential for a tourist industry exists , but the remote location , a lack of adequate facilities , and limited air connections hinder development . Under the original terms of the Compact of Free Association , the US provided $ 1.3 billion in grant aid during the period 1986 - 2001 ; the level of aid has been subsequently reduced . The Amended Compact of Free Association with the US guarantees the Federated States of Micronesia ( FSM ) millions of dollars in annual aid through 2023 , and establishes a Trust Fund into which the US and the FSM make annual contributions in order to provide annual payouts to the FSM in perpetuity after 2023 . The country 's medium-term economic outlook appears fragile due not only to the reduction in US assistance but also to the current slow growth of the private sector . The discovery and exploitation of large oil and gas reserves have contributed to dramatic economic growth but fluctuating oil prices have produced huge swings in GDP growth in recent years . Forestry and farming are also minor components of GDP . Subsistence farming is the dominate form of livelihood . Although pre-independence Equatorial Guinea counted on cocoa production for hard currency earnings , the neglect of the rural economy under successive regimes has diminished potential for agriculture-led growth ( the government has stated its intention to reinvest some oil revenue into agriculture ) . A number of aid programs sponsored by the World Bank and the IMF have been cut off since 1993 because of corruption and mismanagement . Deputy Director Amiin says the station stands by its report that Ethiopian troops took up positions at Baidoa 's airport on Saturday . The government has been widely criticized for its lack of transparency and misuse of oil revenues ; however , in 2010 , under Equatorial Guinea 's candidacy in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative , the government published oil revenue figures for the first time . Undeveloped natural resources include gold , zinc , diamonds , columbite-tantalite , and other base metals . Growth remained strong in 2008 , when oil production peaked , but slowed in 2009 - 10 , as the price of oil and the production level fell . A BOSS who had gone to Canada was taunted by a Citizen of Montreal with having fled to avoid prosecution . \" You do me a grave injustice , \" said the Boss , parting with a pair of tears . \" I came to Canada solely because of its political attractions ; its Government is the most corrupt in the world . \" \" Pray forgive me , \" said the Citizen of Montreal . They fell upon each other 's neck , and at the conclusion of that touching rite the Boss had two watches . There are less than three months until the election , an election that will decide the next President of the United States . The man elected will be the president of all Americans , not just the Democrats or the Republicans . The U.S. military says the trials of three Army reservists charged with abusing detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison will be moved to the United States . To show our solidarity as Americans , let 's all get together and show each other our support for the candidate of our choice . It 's time that we all came together , Democrats and Republicans alike . If you support the policies and character of President George W. Bush , please drive with your headlights on during the day . If you support John Kerry , please drive with your headlights off at night . A topologist is a person who does n't know the difference between a coffee cup and a doughnut . Lawyers get a lot of unjust criticism . I would remind you that it is not right to condemn a whole profession just because of 3,50,000 bad apples . I was very lonely when I was a child . I only had two imaginary friends ... And they would only play with each other . In a statement released late Wednesday , officials say the courts martial of Specialist Charles Graner , Sergeant Javal Davis , and Specialist Sabrina Harman would be held early next year in Fort Hood , Texas instead of Baghdad . The Russian and European space agencies have announced a deal to build a manned spacecraft for near-earth orbits and trips to the moon . Russian news agency reports quote a spokesman for the Russian agency Roskosmos as saying engineers want to test a 20-ton capsule by 2015 . A first launch is planned for 2018 at a launch center in Siberia . Under the pact , Russia will build the capsule , while European engineers build the service module and the engine block . The new craft is to be phased in as the replacement for Russia 's Soyuz spacecraft , which has come under increased scrutiny this year , after two consecutive rough landings on return from the International Space Station . A human-rights group in Niger says the government is to blame for cancellation of a ceremony that was to grant 7,000 slaves their freedom . The group Timidria had planned to release the slaves in the Ates region near Niger 's western border with Mali on Saturday , but the event was called off when none of the slaves showed up . The rights group says the government intimidated slaves to keep them from attending the ceremony - a charge the government denies . Niger officially banned slavery in 2003 , but human-rights groups say 43,000 people are still in bondage in the West African nation . They are among the 2,00,000 people enslaved along centuries-old Arab-African Saharan trade routes . No reason for the change of venue was given . Generations of Africans have been born in slavery , many under the ownership of one family . Embattled Ivory Coast President Laurent Gbagbo has said he wants to talk with his rival , Alassane Ouattara . Mr. Gbagbo has been isolated by the international community , including the United States , after refusing to yield the presidency although he had fewer votes than Mr. Ouattara in last month 's poll . Both men have taken the oath of office and begun organizing competing governments . Earlier this week , the African Union dispatched former South African president Thabo Mbeki to seek a solution , but after two days of talks , the situation was not resolved . The Ivory Coast 's presidential election , its first in 10 years , was meant to restore stability to the West African country , which was split into rebel- and government-controlled areas during a 2002 civil war . Officials in Afghanistan say a suicide bomber has killed four Afghan employees of a U.S.-owned private security firm and wounded one other in southern Kandahar province .

Three guards and the vehicle 's driver were killed , and another guard was wounded . On Saturday , a suicide bomber killed seven police officers and a civilian in eastern Afghanistan 's Khost province , near the Pakistan border . Three other U.S. troops have pleaded guilty in connection with prisoner abuse at the Baghdad prison . The Taleban is reported to have taken responsibility for the blast . NATO forces in Afghanistan are preparing for another upsurge in violence this year , having already launched an operation in the south to preempt an anticipated offensive by Taleban fighters . Turkish police have detained more than 80 people and used tear gas to prevent thousands of leftist protesters from marching to Istanbul 's Taksim square to hold a May Day rally . Authorities declared the square off-limits to protesters , but allowed a small number of trade union leaders to lay flowers at the square to mark the day . Officials had shut down schools in the area for the day for fear of violence . Members of leftist groups often clash with police during May Day observances in Turkey . In 1977 , a May Day rally at Taksim square turned violent when unidentified gunmen opened fire on a crowd of demonstrators . Thirty-seven people were killed in that incident . The race for Iraq 's new prime minister narrowed Tuesday , when one of two top Shi'ite parties withdrew its candidate from consideration . Interim Finance Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi , who had been the candidate of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq , withdrew his name from contention . Most of those charged were part of a military police company based in the U.S. state of Maryland . This leaves the head of the Islamic Dawa Party , Ibrahim al-Jaafari , as the likely front-runner . Both parties belong to the United Iraqi Alliance , which won about 48 percent of the vote for the National Assembly . Meanwhile , Iraq 's Electoral Commission says it has received at least three complaints from political groups challenging the election results . A final , certified vote tally is expected Wednesday . And Turkish shipping magnate Kahraman Sadikoglu , who was abducted in southern Iraq in December , has been freed after reports said his family paid a ransom to his kidnappers . A Council of Europe panel says Turkey has passed important legislation protecting minority rights , but has not adequately enforced the new laws . In a report , the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance says that despite the new legislation , Turkey 's constitution and its civil , criminal and administrative laws continue to have gaps in addressing racism . The report , issued Tuesday in Strasbourg , says Kurds and other minorities still face adversity in Turkey , particularly from ongoing violence in the southeast where Kurdish separatists have been active in recent decades . Turkey 's move to push through legal and economic reforms is considered an essential part of its bid to join the European Union . The Council of Europe is a 46-nation group that brings together lawmakers from democratic European countries to review major issues facing the continent . The prisoner abuse scandal erupted in April when photographs of U.S. soldiers taunting and humiliating naked Iraqi prisoners became public , sparking worldwide condemnation . Armenia has launched an aerial tramway line that it says is the world 's longest . President Serzh Sarkisian attended the opening of the tramway Saturday , in the country 's southern mountains near Armenia 's border with Iran .

The monastery is one of the country 's oldest and most prominent monasteries and is a major tourist attraction . The head of Cuba 's parliament has offered to support Iran in its fight to develop nuclear energy within Iranian borders . Ricardo Alarcon voiced solidarity Thursday in a meeting with the visiting speaker of Iran 's parliament , Gholam Ali Haddad Adel . Iran resumed enrichment of uranium for nuclear fuel earlier this week , despite international pressure against the move . Haddad Adel is on a two-day visit to Cuba after spending Wednesday in Venezuela , where he thanked the government for its support on nuclear issues . Meanwhile , Indiana Representative Dan Burton , in an interview with Voice of America Thursday , expressed concern over the close ties between Iran and the two countries . He said if it appears that there is coordination between terrorist states and leftist organizations in Central America , the United States will intervene . A Mexican diplomat says he has met with the leader of Colombia 's second largest rebel group in an effort to broker a peace deal between the group and the Colombian government . Representative Burton said such a relationship would endanger the United States and other countries in the hemisphere . European Union foreign ministers hold emergency talks in Luxembourg Sunday in efforts to break a deadlock on Turkey , which is scheduled to begin membership negotiations with the bloc one day later . The ministers called the meeting after Austria insisted that EU talks with Turkey should include an alternative to giving the country full membership . Austria says most Austrians object to full EU membership for Turkey and suggested offering Turkey privileged partnership instead . But Turkey calls that unacceptable and says it will not take part in Monday 's talks unless it is clear that the goal is full membership . EU diplomats are working on proposals to soften Austrian opposition . One would be a commitment to begin membership talks with Austria 's neighbor Croatia in the near future . EU ministers had delayed the talks because of Croatian failure to cooperate fully with The Hague war crimes tribunal . Pakistani military authorities say they have arrested a key Taliban commander who is accused of slaughtering military personnel . Security forces said Wednesday they captured Taliban commander Sher Mohammad Qasab in the Swat Valley . Mexico 's Andres Valencia told reporters late Tuesday his talks with National Liberation Army ( ELN ) leader Francisco Galan focused on ways to reduce differences between the rebels and the government in order to set up a possible meeting between the two sides in Mexico . Qasab is known for his brutality among locals in the valley . A military spokesman said Qasab was wounded and three of his sons died during an exchange of fire before his arrest . Pakistani forces have arrested key Taliban commanders recently in the valley , including Muslim Khan , the central spokesman for the militants . Authorities say the arrests have weakened the Taliban and are helping security forces conduct successful raids against other militants in the area . The top U.S. diplomat says China should make significant economic reforms so it does not continue to be a \" problem for the international economy . \" In a New York Times newspaper interview , published Friday , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice says Washington also worries about China 's military buildup , human rights practices and religious restrictions . It is a change of tone for Ms. Rice , who generally casts Sino-American relations in a positive light . Her comments come just a month before Chinese President Hu Jintao makes his first visit to Washington since taking office in 2003 . He will arrive amid Washington 's complaints that China manipulates the value of its currency to make its products unfairly cheap on world markets . Beijing recently changed the value of its currency slightly , but U.S. critics say the change is not large enough to make trade fair . Russian officials say at least five more people have died from a wave of extremely cold weather gripping the nation , bringing the death toll to 43 in the past week . The Colombian government is demanding the group disarm and cease its practice of kidnapping citizens . Chad 's national assembly has authorized President Idriss Deby to renew a state of emergency imposed after a rebel attack on the capital , N'Djamena , early this month . The parliament voted Friday to extend the emergency measure for another 15 days , until March 15 .

Nepal 's parliament has unanimously approved a resolution to curtail King Gyanendra 's powers . Details of the declaration have not yet been released , but the resolution is expected to remove the king 's command over the 90,000 member army , as well as his right to make decisions on major issues . Those powers are to be given to parliament . Earlier Thursday , Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala told parliament members that the proclamation represents the feelings of all people in Nepal . Curtailing the king 's powers was a key demand during last month 's pro-democracy protests , which forced King Gyanendra to give up total control of the government and reinstate parliament . While other paramilitary groups in the nation have grown rich from the drug trade , the ELN funds itself through kidnapping . Nepal 's interim cabinet banned rallies today near the parliament and other key government buildings in Kathmandu . Two days ago , there were demonstrations against the delay in curbing the king 's powers . Iraqi defense lawyers representing Saddam Hussein before a special tribunal say they have suspended all contact with the court until their safety is guaranteed . In a statement , the lawyers cited the kidnapping and murder last week of their colleague Saadoun al-Janabi who represented one of Saddam 's co-defendants . They said the deteriorating security situation also makes it impossible to have a fair and open trial . They have demanded U.N. protection , as well as the hiring of 15 bodyguards for each lawyer , and an independent international investigation into their colleague 's murder . Saddam Hussein and seven associates entered \" not guilty \" pleas at the opening of their trial last Wednesday for the 1982 murders of 143 Shi'ite men in the town of Dujail . The trial was adjourned until November 28 . Israeli police have lifted an alert in Tel Aviv , hours after warning of a possible attack .

Patrick Fequiere says authorities need more time to prepare ballots , distribute voter identification cards and set up polling places . The election council member 's comments come three days after U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice urged Haitian officials to speed up preparations for the November 20 vote . The nine-member council has approved about 30 presidential candidates for the first round of balloting . The country will also hold legislative elections . The vote will be Haiti 's first since former president Jean-Betrand Aristide fled the country during a 2004 uprising . About 7,000 U.N. peacekeepers have been deployed to calm widespread violence in Haiti . Israel has allowed the first commercial shipment of shoes and clothing into the Gaza Strip in almost two years . Smaller shipments have been allowed to enter Gaza through international aid groups , but Sunday 's shipments are the first to reach private traders . Richard Boucher , the U.S. assistant secretary of state for south and central Asian affairs , says about one third of the Afghan economy was based on opium last year . Smugglers have skirted the blockade by bringing in goods though a tunnel under the Egypt-Gaza border . British-based human rights group Amnesty International called for an end to the blockade in January , saying it is \" suffocating \" Gaza 's 1.4 million residents . An Israeli military offensive into Gaza in December 2008 to stop cross-border rocket attacks by Hamas militants killed at least 1,300 Palestinians and 13 Israelis . Ivorian officials say 11 people in a major cocoa-growing region have been killed in an attack believed to have been triggered by a land dispute .

Oil refineries , drilling platforms and pipelines largely escaped damage from Hurricane Rita , sending prices down to about $ 64 a barrel in Monday morning trading . The falling prices were unlike the dramatic spike that followed Hurricane Katrina , but that has not eased worries among industry analysts and politicians about the tight oil supply . But he added that its production was diminishing due to the growth of the regular economy , including the cultivation of other crops . Nearly all the major refineries along the Gulf of Mexico were shut down before or during Hurricane Rita , cutting total U.S. oil production by nearly 30 percent . With little excess refining capacity , analysts say oil prices remain vulnerable to even minor disruptions in the global supply . The U.S. Energy Department Monday will brief President Bush on damage to Gulf oil facilities and the status of the nation 's energy industry . Reports from Sudan say dozens of people were killed when a plane veered off a runway at Khartoum 's airport and burst into flames .

In July 2003 , a Sudan Airways plane crashed soon after takeoff near Port Sudan , killing 115 people . Ukraine 's Deputy Prime Minister Mykola Azarov says U.S. plans to build a missile defense system in central Europe are a threat to Ukraine . Azarov said Monday that such a system close to the Ukrainian border would be a target of attack and threaten to suck Ukraine into a conflict . Washington says it wants to build missile defense sites in Poland and the Czech Republic to counter a possible threat by North Korean and Iranian long-range missiles . Russia has also called the plans a mistake and has noted that neither North Korea nor Iran have such missiles . The Pentagon has acknowledged that Iran does not currently possess long-range missiles , but says it is important to stay one step ahead . The African Union has extended the mandate for its Darfur peacekeeping mission until the end of the year as it waits to assemble a combined force with the United Nations . The African Union said in a statement Friday that it hopes efforts to deploy the hybrid force will be speeded up . Sudan agreed this month to the joint African Union - United Nations force of around 20,000 peacekeepers after months of international pressure and threats of tougher U.N. sanctions . The African Union already has about 7,000 peacekeepers in Darfur , but they have not been able to stop the region 's violence . The country is the world 's number one producer of opium , a key ingredient in heroin . Sudanese government-backed Arab militias are accused of committing atrocities in battling Darfur rebels . Four years of fighting in Darfur has left more than 2,00,000 people dead and more than two million displaced . A U.S. Defense Department spokesman says Uzbekistan has restricted American military flights from its soil in recent weeks . But the spokesman refused to link the change directly to U.S. criticism of the Uzbek government 's violent crackdown on anti-government protesters last month . He said Uzbekistan has stopped allowing U.S. nighttime flights from its air base at Karshi-Khanabad , which American forces use to support operations and supply humanitarian aid to neighboring Afghanistan . He said the U.S. military has been working around the restrictions . Uzbekistan opened the airfield to U.S. forces in the aftermath of the September 11 , 2001 , terror attacks in the United States .

He said China must push the military junta in Rangoon to open real dialogue with the democratic opposition . China -- a major supplier of weapons to Burma -- has been criticized by some diplomats for not taking a tougher stand toward Burma 's military leaders after the September crackdown on pro-democracy protests . Kouchner said it was largely due to Beijing 's influence that U.N. envoy Ibrahim Gambari was able to travel to Burma at the end of last month . The U.S. military says an American soldier has been killed and two others wounded in fighting with Taleban rebels in southern Afghanistan . Seven militants were reported captured Tuesday during the fighting in Uruzgan province , the scene of a spate of suicide bombings in recent months .

South Africa 's government says it will move away from coal and promote use of wind and nuclear energy in an effort to fight global warming . Environment Minister Marthinus van Schalkwyk told a news conference Monday that options being considered include mandatory energy efficiency targets and a possible tax on carbon dioxide emissions . South Africa generates most of its electricity using coal , a major source of the so-called greenhouse gases blamed for climate change . Van Schalkwyk said no new coal-fired power stations would be approved unless they use technology that captures and stores carbon emissions . He said if action is taken now , South Africa 's greenhouse gas emissions should stabilize by 2025 and then begin to decline . He said the Cabinet 's decisions show the government and the country are committed to a \" low carbon economy . \" Mohammed Deif , who has eluded Israeli authorities for more than a decade , said Israel 's pullout is a humiliation suffered at the hands of the armed resistance .

Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for a timetable for the withdrawal of foreign military forces from Iraq . At a joint news conference with Jordan 's King Abdullah Thursday , the Russian leader said many Iraqis perceive the foreign troops as an occupying force . He said a phased pull-out of coalition forces would help defuse the violence in Iraq and would help convince a considerable number of those involved in the Iraqi insurgency to join efforts for building a new political system in the war-torn country . Mr. Putin also called for an international conference on Iraq to be held by the end of this year , saying it will give an added impulse to normalizing the situation in Iraq .

Local media say anti-terror security forces captured Subur Sugiarto on a bus in Central Java on Wednesday . Several police sources said Subur Sugiarto was part of Top 's inner circle of accomplices . Top is a senior member of Jemaah Islamiah , an Islamist militant group seen as the Southeast Asian arm of al-Qaida . He is blamed for helping mastermind a string of bombings in recent years in Indonesia , including the 2002 Bali nightclub attacks that killed 202 people . Palestinian medical officials say an Israeli aircraft has fired rockets at a car traveling in the southern Gaza Strip , killing a senior Palestinian militant and wounding at least 10 other people . Palestinian medics say three of the wounded are in critical condition . An Israeli army statement said aircraft had targeted a senior militant accused of involvement in sniper fire and other attacks against Israeli troops . Western news agencies in Gaza received copies of the tape overnight Saturday . Israel repeatedly warned earlier this week that it would launch strikes against Palestinian targets to avenge a suicide bombing Monday inside Israel . The Palestinian militant Islamic Jihad organization claimed responsibility for Monday 's blast , which killed five Israelis in Netanya . Earlier this week , Israeli Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz ordered the army to resume its practice of targeting senior militants for assassination . The Israeli military says it has arrested a senior commander of the Palestinian faction Hamas after he spent more than a decade on the run .

The U.S. says most of the $ 18.7 million will help provide food assistance through the United Nations World Food Program . Some funds also will help pay for health , nutrition , and livelihood programs . Years of drought , flooding , civil conflict , disease and food shortages have left residents in Ogaden vulnerable to poverty and famine . Ethiopia 's Ogaden , also known as the Somali region , is an oil-rich , but poor area that is ethnically Somali . It has long sought autonomy from Addis Ababa . Former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has asked The Hague tribunal to subpoena British Prime Minister Tony Blair and former U.S. President Bill Clinton as defense witnesses in his war crimes case . Pope John Paul II has urged believers to proudly display the signs of their faith , saying the practice does not encourage intolerance or infringe on the separation of church and state . Mr. Milosevic said he has sent letters to embassies of a number of western countries requesting the testimony . But he said their responses indicate the officials are not willing to appear . The judges instructed Mr. Milosevic to present his request in writing . His witness list also includes former U.S , Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping . Mr. Milosevic 's request came as he resumed conducting his own case after the court reversed an order forcing him to accept appointed counsel because of concerns about his failing health . Mr. Milosevic faces more than 60 counts of war crimes in the Balkan conflicts of the 1990s . Ethiopia 's foreign ministry says authorities have pardoned nearly 18,000 prisoners to mark the occasion of the country 's third millennium .

It said the pardons were issued September 11 , on the eve of the nation 's new year and millennium celebration . Ethiopia celebrated the new millennium on September 12 - seven years after the rest of most of the world . In an apostolic letter to Roman Catholics launching the Year of the Eucharist , the pope made no mention of specific problems . Ethiopia follows the Julian calendar , instead of the more common Gregorian calendar . It is not the first time the nation has issued pardons at the new year . Last year , at this time , Ethiopia pardoned more than 14,000 prisoners . The ministry suggested more pardons could be coming , saying that the pardon boards in the Afar and Somali regions are still examining applications .

The spokesman for the U.N. 's Food and Agriculture Organization , Assadullah Azhari , says laboratory tests in Italy detected the virus in samples from dead chickens found in Kapisa province , northeast of the capital , Kabul . The H5N1 strain of bird flu has already been found in the capital , Kabul , and the eastern provinces of Logar and Nangarhar . The U.N. official says there are strong suspicions the virus has reached two other provinces , Laghman and Parwan , but says further testing is needed . The official says the FAO is supporting efforts by Afghan authorities to strengthen nationwide surveillance of suspected bird flu outbreaks . No human cases of bird flu have been reported in Afghanistan . But the message follows sharp controversy in France over a government ban on conspicuous religious symbols such as Muslim headscarves , Jewish skullcaps or large crucifixes in the country 's schools .

Australian Prime Minister John Howard says a hasty pullout of foreign troops from Iraq would represent a defeat for the West . In an interview on Australian television , Mr. Howard says such a defeat would undermine Australia 's security and the authority of the United States as a world superpower . He says anyone who believes withdrawing from Iraq will strengthen the West \" has taken leave of their senses \" . The pontiff also repeated his concern that too few Catholics are giving due reverence to the Eucharist or properly marking Sunday as the Lord 's Day . Australia has about 1,300 troops in Iraq as part of the U.S.-led coalition . Mr. Howard warned against pulling Australian troops out while other coalition forces remain . He says doing so would cause long-term damage to Australia 's alliance with the U.S. Mr. Howard reiterated his support for the U.S. position that foreign forces should only leave Iraq when the Iraqis can look after security themselves . Former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell has criticized the Hurricane Katrina relief effort . In a taped ABC television interview to air late Friday , Mr. Powell expressed his opinion that \" there have been a lot of failures at a lot of levels - [ of ] local , state and federal [ government ] . \" The former top U.S. diplomat said \" there was more than enough warning over time about the dangers to New Orleans , \" but not enough was done . Mr. Powell , who was the highest ranking black official during President Bush 's first term , says he does not believe race was a factor in the slow response to the hurricane . Mr. Powell says many of those unable to evacuate New Orleans before Katrina struck were trapped by poverty , which disproportionately affects blacks . New studies by British and French researchers show quick treatment for minor strokes can dramatically cut the risk of major strokes later . The research , published in the journals Lancetand Lancet Neurology , found that patients treated within 24 hours for so-called mini-strokes cut the later risk of a major stroke by about 80 percent . He also described faith as a means of counteracting violence and a way of bringing attention to such problems as poverty and hunger in the world . Oxford researcher Peter Rothwell says the vast majority of British stroke patients wait several weeks before reporting mini-stroke symptoms to health care professionals . The second study by French researchers also found that the early , aggressive treatment of mini-strokes brought similar benefits . Strokes occur when blood flow to the brain is blocked . Such events kill brain tissue and are one of the leading causes of death or permanent disability worldwide . Symptoms include facial numbness , slurred speech , partial paralysis and sudden headaches . Treatments include blood thinning drugs and anti-cholesterol medications . Crude oil prices fell Wednesday after a U.S. government report showed an increase in inventories , reflecting decreased demand . The price of a barrel of oil for future delivery fell 35 cents [ about one percent ] to $ 38.68 a barrel during trading in New York .

Mr. Lahoud made no public comments after the visit . Mr. Lahoud and Cabinet members were told by Hariri 's family not to attend Wednesday 's funeral in Beirut , which attracted more than 2,00,000 mourners . The Hariri family and Lebanese opposition politicians accuse Syria , the main power broker in Lebanon , of involvement in Monday 's car bomb attack that killed Mr. Hariri . Clinton was speaking in Pakistan , the scene of some of the worst rallies against the drawings , where he was visiting survivors of last year 's South Asian earthquake and launching an HIV / AIDS project . Damascus has denied any role in the assassination . Meanwhile , Lebanese officials say they are searching for several men who flew from Beirut to Australia shortly after the attack . The French News Agency quotes Lebanon 's Justice Minister as saying traces of explosives were found on their aircraft 's seats . Oil prices went as high as $ 103.05 a barrel in Friday 's trading - the highest price ever recorded - before easing slightly . It is the latest in a string of record-highs set in recent days as a weakening U.S. dollar and the threat of inflation makes tangible assets like oil and other commodities more attractive to investors . Speculators interpreted recent comments by the head of the U.S. central bank Ben Bernanke as pointing to further interest rate cuts . Interest rate reductions are intended to boost U.S. economic growth , but can also further weaken the dollar .

He said he strongly disagrees with the publication of the cartoons , considered blasphemous by Muslims , and has no objection to the Muslim protests if they are peaceful . Earlier reports said Mr. Latortue was sending a representative to talk with Mr. Aristide and South African President Thabo Mbeki . Mr. Aristide has been living in exile in South Africa since he was forced from power last February . The reports said the envoy would try to convince Mr. Aristide to persuade his followers to stop fighting his foes and help stabilize Haiti before elections planned this year . More than 200 people have died in the violence since September . United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has warned governments around the world not to ignore international agreements prohibiting torture . In a statement issued for International Human Rights Day Saturday , Mr. Annan said there has been a disturbing trend of nations claiming exceptions to prohibitions on torture , based on their own national security perceptions . The U.N. chief said torture can never be a tool to fight terror , but rather is an instrument of terror . In a separate statement , 33 U.N. human rights experts expressed alarm at attempts by many countries to circumvent international human rights laws by giving new names to practices such as torture . The experts called on governments to respect human rights standards and to not ignore them when they become , in the statement 's wording , \" inconvenient . \" Meteorologists say the storm known as Rita has strengthened into a category 1 hurricane . But he said by holding violent demonstrations that have killed 18 people , Muslims have missed an opportunity to build better ties with the West . The U.S. National Hurricane Center says Rita is packing winds of about 120 kilometers per hour as it moves west , past the Bahamas and toward the Florida Keys . The storm reportedly caused little damage in the Bahamas . However , thousands of tourists and residents have fled the Keys , a low-lying chain of islands off Florida 's southern coast . Hurricane warnings remain in effect for the Keys and parts of western Cuba , including Havana .

Hassan Rohani told reporters Tuesday in Tehran that Iran will only suspend uranium enrichment for the length of international negotiations on the country 's nuclear program , which he says should take months , not years . A U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Monday the world must \" remain vigilant \" about Iran 's nuclear ambitions . He said if Iran fails to uphold the terms of Monday 's European-brokered resolution , the International Atomic Energy Agency should immediately refer Tehran to the U.N. Security Council for the possible imposition of sanctions . Washington has accused Tehran of violating the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty with a secret nuclear weapons development program . Iran has repeatedly denied the charges . Russian police confirm that a shrapnel-packed bomb exploded Sunday in a McDonald 's restaurant in St. Petersburg , injuring six people .

A military spokesman Monday said U.S. forces tracked the drone in Iraqi airspace for one hour and ten minutes before shooting it down , about 100 kilometers north of Baghdad . The spokesman added that \" this was not an accident on the part of the Iranians . \" The incident was first reported by Wired.com earlier this month but , at the time , the U.S. military declined comment . Washington has previously accused Iran of meddling in the affairs of neighboring Iraq , where the U.S. has had troops since it invaded the country in 2003 . The Palestinian militant group Hamas Thursday banned men from working in hair salons or beauty parlors that cater to women , part of a campaign to enforce a stricter interpretation of Muslim law . Hamas officials said any man who continues to cut women 's hair will be arrested and tried in court . A foreign ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi told reporters Sunday in Tehran that International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors would only take samples from so-called \" green areas \" at the military site , and not from inside the installation . Islamic extremists in Gaza have been waging a campaign against cafes and shops that sell or play music deemed unsuitable , as well as against Christian institutions . They have called on Hamas to impose a more fundamentalist brand of Islam . One hairdresser who is impacted by the ban - Barakat al-Ghoul - told the Associated Press he fears he will no longer be able to make a living . Al-Ghoul said he had been cutting women 's hair for 26 years . He insisted he did not violate Islamic law because he only cuts hair and does not do makeup .

The report says the officials discussed new evidence that Pyongyang may have sold to Libya a form of uranium used in nuclear weapons . The IAEA has been seeking access to Parchin , which has long been used by Iran to research , develop and produce missiles and other high explosives . The Times quotes Asian officials who say China has promised to send a delegation to North Korea . But the officials say China also advised President Bush against making the kind of public statements about the North Korean situation as he did about Iraq 's alleged threat before the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 . Iran 's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has ordered state-run broadcasters to stop playing Western and so-called \" indecent \" music . Iranian media reported Monday that he asked the agency in charge of television and radio broadcasts , the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting , to implement the change within six months . Mr. Ahmadinejad also called for the government to supervise the content of foreign-made television shows and films .

A leading international human rights group says it is \" deeply concerned \" for the safety of Iranian Nobel Laureate Shirin Ebadi , who has refused an order to appear before Iran 's hard-line Revolutionary Court . Human Rights Watch called the court summons a \" blatant attempt \" by Iran 's government to \" silence one of the few remaining voices of human rights \" in the Islamic Republic . In Tehran Sunday , a Foreign Ministry spokesman said the human rights lawyer was the subject of a private complaint . However , Ms. Ebadi , in comments to Reuters news agency , cast doubt on the use of the Revolutionary Court for such complaints , noting that the tribunal handles national security matters . Saturday , Ms. Ebadi said she would not honor the court summons , because it failed to state the charges against her . Failure to appear could land her in prison .

Fort McPherson in Georgia was one of the approved closures . In May , the Pentagon recommended the closure of military installations from Maine to Hawaii . They say the suspects may have had contact with al-Qaida 's second-in-command , Ayman al-Zawahri , and may have been trained in Afghanistan . Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said the plan would save $ 49 billion over 20 years and make it easier to deploy forces quickly . President Bush must certify a final list of base closures recommended by the commission and submit the list to Congress for approval .

Mr. Putin offered no specific suggestions , but ordered submission of amendments to the controversial bill within five days . As presently written , the bill would subject Russian branches of foreign organizations to various restrictions and to the oversight of Russian authorities . Human rights groups have condemned the measure , calling it a reflection of the Kremlin 's crackdown on civil society institutions . President Putin said Monday that such a bill is necessary to combat the threats of terrorism and what he called \" misanthropic ideologies . \" But , he said , a civil society is crucial , and Russia can not afford to curtail that development . A Netherlands court has opened a pretrial hearing in the case of a Dutch businessman charged with complicity in genocide by selling chemical weapons ingredients to ousted Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein . Frans van Anraat appeared Friday in a Rotterdam courtroom . Khodorkovsky , once Russia 's richest man , was convicted in May in what his supporters call a political trial in retaliation for the tycoon 's backing of opposition politicians . The 62-year-old defendant is accused of exporting tons of chemicals that Iraq used to make weapons over a four-year period beginning in 1984 . Prosecutors say Saddam used the weapons in the 1988 attack on the Kurdish town of Halabja that killed 5,000 people . Some survivors of the attack attended Friday 's hearing .

But her political party has suggested that Ms. Bhutto 's political opponents may have played a role in the plot . U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon announced the creation of the fact-finding commission after meeting with Ms. Bhutto 's widower , Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari , in Islamabad last February . Ms. Bhutto was killed in a bomb attack after addressing an election rally near the Pakistani capital .

The eight were suspended for health reasons and not for doping . AU officials say the suspension will last several weeks . They include 2002 gold medalist Evi Sachenbacher of Germany . A high red blood cell count can occur naturally , but can also result from taking endurance-boosting drugs such as EPO . Two Americans - Kikkan Randall and Leif Zimmermann - are among the eight . The International Ski Federation says the suspensions are not punishments , but to protect the athletes ' health . The U.S. Ski Federation says the suspensions are retroactive to Wednesday when the tests were conducted . The only cross-country events that fall within the five-day suspension are the men 's and women 's pursuit races Sunday .

The report by Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction Stuart Bowen has prompted a criminal investigation into the missing money . Mr. Bowen 's report , released Thursday , describes how tens of millions of dollars were dispersed for Iraq construction projects with little or no documentation during 2003 and 2004 . The report says that while incompetence or haste may account for some problems , there are indications of fraud . The force is monitoring a cease-fire between Darfur rebels and pro-government Arab militia . The inspector general notes the money in question was not U.S. taxpayer dollars but rather Iraqi money designated for reconstruction projects .

But one of the first to come on line has been met with stiff opposition in the United Kingdom . Paul Burge reports for VOA from London . The Israeli army says its soldiers patrolling the border with Egypt have mistakenly shot and wounded an Egyptian security officer . China says at least 37 miners died early Sunday in a coal mine accident in the central province of Henan . A military spokeswoman Monday said Israeli troops on patrol outside the city of Eilat saw what they considered a suspicious , armed person at the border . She said the troops fired at the man after he cocked his weapon . The Israeli army says the soldiers only then realized the man , who was wounded in the chest , was an Egyptian security officer . A joint Israeli-Egyptian team is investigating the incident . Shootings between Israeli and Egyptian forces along the border region have been rare since the two countries signed a peace treaty in 1979 .

Mr. Stronach will direct an effort to reduce overhead and curb capital spending \" until a more satisfactory level of profit is achieved and maintained , \" Magna said . Stephen Akerfeldt , currently vice president finance , will succeed Mr. McAlpine . An ambitious expansion has left Magna with excess capacity and a heavy debt load as the automotive industry enters a downturn . The company has reported declines in operating profit in each of the past three years , despite steady sales growth . Magna recently cut its quarterly dividend in half and the company 's Class A shares are wallowing far below their 52-week high of 16.125 Canadian dollars ( US $ 13.73 ) .

Magna said Mr. McAlpine resigned to pursue a consulting career , with Magna as one of his clients . Resistance by native Caribs prevented colonization on Saint Vincent until 1719 . Disputed between France and the United Kingdom for most of the 18th century , the island was ceded to the latter in 1783 . Between 1960 and 1962 , Saint Vincent and the Grenadines was a separate administrative unit of the Federation of the West Indies . Autonomy was granted in 1969 and independence in 1979 . The Slovene lands were part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until the latter 's dissolution at the end of World War I . In 1918 , the Slovenes joined the Serbs and Croats in forming a new multinational state , which was named Yugoslavia in 1929 . After World War II , Slovenia became a republic of the renewed Yugoslavia , which though Communist , distanced itself from Moscow 's rule . Dissatisfied with the exercise of power by the majority Serbs , the Slovenes succeeded in establishing their independence in 1991 after a short 10-day war . The accident happened one day after a fire at a coal mine in northeastern China killed at least five miners and trapped 30 . Historical ties to Western Europe , a strong economy , and a stable democracy have assisted in Slovenia 's transformation to a modern state . Slovenia acceded to both NATO and the EU in the spring of 2004 ; it joined the eurozone in 2007 . The use of the name Montenegro began in the 15th century when the Crnojevic dynasty began to rule the Serbian principality of Zeta ; over subsequent centuries Montenegro was able to maintain its independence from the Ottoman Empire . From the 16th to 19th centuries , Montenegro became a theocracy ruled by a series of bishop princes ; in 1852 , it was transformed into a secular principality . After World War I , Montenegro was absorbed by the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats , and Slovenes , which became the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929 ; at the conclusion of World War II , it became a constituent republic of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia . When the latter dissolved in 1992 , Montenegro federated with Serbia , first as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and , after 2003 , in a looser union of Serbia and Montenegro . In May 2006 , Montenegro invoked its right under the Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro to hold a referendum on independence from the state union . The vote for severing ties with Serbia exceeded 55 % - the threshold set by the EU - allowing Montenegro to formally declare its independence on 3 June 2006 . Basutoland was renamed the Kingdom of Lesotho upon independence from the UK in 1966 . The Basuto National Party ruled for the first two decades . Xinhua said the fire broke out Saturday at a mine in Hegang City , Heilongjiang province , while 44 miners were working underground . King MOSHOESHOE was exiled in 1990 , but returned to Lesotho in 1992 and was reinstated in 1995 and subsequently succeeded by his son , King LETSIE III , in 1996 . Constitutional government was restored in 1993 after seven years of military rule . In 1998 , violent protests and a military mutiny following a contentious election prompted a brief but bloody intervention by South African and Botswana military forces under the aegis of the Southern African Development Community . Subsequent constitutional reforms restored relative political stability . Peaceful parliamentary elections were held in 2002 , but the National Assembly elections of February 2007 were hotly contested and aggrieved parties continue to dispute how the electoral law was applied to award proportional seats in the Assembly . Tourism , petroleum refining , and offshore finance are the mainstays of this small economy , which is closely tied to the outside world . Although GDP grew slightly during the past decade , the island enjoys a high per capita income and a well-developed infrastructure compared with other countries in the region . Curacao has an excellent natural harbor that can accommodate large oil tankers . The Venezuelan state oil company leases the single refinery on the island from the government ; most of the oil for the refinery is imported from Venezuela ; most of the refined products are exported to the US . Almost all consumer and capital goods are imported , with the US , Brazil , Italy , and Mexico being the major suppliers . China 's coal mines are the world 's deadliest , with thousands of people dying every year in explosions , cave-ins and floods . The government is attempting to diversify its industry and trade and has signed an Association Agreement with the EU to expand business there . Poor soils and inadequate water supplies hamper the development of agriculture . Budgetary problems complicate reform of the health and pension systems for an aging population . A quarrel had arisen between the Horse and the Stag , so the Horse came to a Hunter to ask his help to take revenge on the Stag . The Hunter agreed , but said : \" If you desire to conquer the Stag , you must permit me to place this piece of iron between your jaws , so that I may guide you with these reins , and allow this saddle to be placed upon your back so that I may keep steady upon you as we follow after the enemy . \" The Horse agreed to the conditions , and the Hunter soon saddled and bridled him . Then with the aid of the Hunter the Horse soon overcame the Stag , and said to the Hunter : \" Now , get off , and remove those things from my mouth and back . \" \" Not so fast , friend , \" said the Hunter . \" I have now got you under bit and spur , and prefer to keep you as you are at present . \" If you allow men to use you for your own purposes , they will use you for theirs .

China is sending a medical team to its earthquake ravaged southwest to offer reverse sterilization surgery for women who lost their only children in the May 12th quake . China 's \" one-child \" policy limits most families to a single child in most cases and many mothers opt for sterilization surgery after giving birth . Thousands of schools collapsed during the May 12th earthquake and by some estimates more than 6,000 students died . The offer of reverse sterilization surgery comes as Chinese authorities block access to schools destroyed by the quake in an apparent effort to quell demonstrations by angry , grieving parents . But analysts predict that no party will win an outright majority , and that a coalition of Shi'ites and Kurds will likely govern .

No date has been given for those talks . Tensions between Fatah and Hamas have been high for months . Last month , forces from each side fought open street battles in Gaza and the West Bank . At least 17 people died in that fighting . A ceasefire agreed to last week has largely ended the violence , but has done little to resolve the standoff . A presidential panel says U.S. intelligence about Iran 's arms capabilities is \" inadequate . \" The first round of historic trade negotiations between Australia and China is under way in Sydney .

The chairman of China 's National People 's Congress told trade forum members Monday that relations between the two countries have never been better . China is Australia 's third-largest trading partner . China supplies consumer goods and clothing while key Australian exports include iron ore , wheat , petroleum and coal .

A U.N. humanitarian coordinator in the quake zone , Rashid Khalikov , called the agreement a good step that will help extend aid to people in isolated areas . But with a bitter Himalayan winter approaching and millions of people homeless or needing shelter , aid workers fear hunger , disease , diarrhea and injuries that are not treated could kill thousands more . The report says America lacks the intelligence on Tehran 's arms to allow firm judgments about its weapons programs . Some 2,00,000 people are still without any humanitarian aid three weeks after the quake that killed about 55,000 people , most of them in Pakistani Kashmir .

It said the losses hurt the economy and are ultimately counterproductive , creating bad habits and distorting worker conduct . In the statement released on state-run media , the union said Cuba would change its labor structure and salary system and increase private sector job opportunities . Currently , the state employs 95 percent of the official work force . Several weeks ago , Cuban President Raul Castro said his government would scale back its involvement in the nation 's economy and allow more Cubans to operate their own businesses and hire workers . Tehran insists its nuclear program is for civilian purposes . He said the aim was to create jobs for Cubans employed by the government who will be laid off .

Officials call the operation a success and say most of the Taliban insurgents have been driven from the region . The U.S. space agency NASA says the Phoenix Mars probe landed in an ideal location to search for evidence that the planet could support life . At a news conference Tuesday NASA scientists said the probe is located in a valley in the polar region believed to contain subterranean ice . Phoenix is designed to dig through the Martian soil and into the layer of ice to look for the basic chemical components essential to supporting life . NASA says there were few problems with the landing Sunday , though a radio glitch on a spacecraft orbiting Mars will likely delay the scheduled mission by about one day . A team of Canadian scientists reports clear skies at the landing site , with temperatures ranging between negative 30 and negative 80 degrees Celsius , and with 32 kilometer per hour winds .

The appeal came after about 2,00,000 opposition supporters marched on the presidential office in Kiev to demand that their candidate - Viktor Yushchenko - be declared the winner of the election . Official preliminary results showed the pro-Russian Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich winning the vote . Mr. Kuchma , a backer of the prime minister , called the protests a \" political farce \" that he says could lead to \" unforseeable consequences . \" U.S. and European observers reported indications of extensive voter fraud in Sunday 's election . Russian President Vladimir Putin called European criticism inadmissible because final results have not been announced .

Israel has charged nuclear whistleblower Mordechai Vanunu with violating the terms of his release from prison . Vanunu was freed from an Israeli jail last year after serving an 18-year sentence for revealing secrets of Israel 's nuclear program to a British journalist in the 1980s . Under terms of his release , the former Israeli nuclear technician was barred from contacting foreigners or leaving the country . He was re-arrested in November , after granting another interview in which he said Israel has up to 200 atomic warheads , a neutron bomb , and hydrogen bombs . Israel has never admitted or denied having a nuclear arsenal . Reuters news agency reports a new indictment includes charges that Vanunu , a Christian convert , also violated release terms by trying to visit the West Bank in December to attend a midnight Christmas religious service .

Hamas ' political leader says the Islamic group will not renew a truce with Israel that expires at the end of this year . At a rally in a Palestinian refugee camp near the Syrian capital Friday , Khaled Mashaal said Hamas would not enter a new truce while the Palestinian people are preparing for a new round of conflict . Later , Mr. Mashaal told al-Jazeera television that the current truce would not be affected , but that calls for extending it are unrealistic . He accused Israel of carrying out targeted assassinations , arrests and airstrikes in violation of the truce . He said all Iran has to do is inform the International Atomic Energy Agency that it would be resuming operations . Israel says such actions are in self-defense . The Associated Press reports the Palestinian Authority said Mr. Mashaal 's statement was \" irresponsible \" and a violation of the truce . The commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan says the international community has underestimated the resurgence of the Taleban , partly because the war in Iraq diverted attention and resources . Lieutenant-General David Richards told BBC Thursday that the international community \" took their eye off this ball and a vacuum was allowed to develop \" in Afghanistan . The British general said the war in Iraq absorbed people 's interest and resources for a while . But he said he is optimistic the insurgency in Afghanistan can be defeated . Afghanistan in recent months has suffered the worst violence since a U.S.-led attack ousted the Taleban government in December 2001 , in part for failing to hand over Osama bin Laden . Fighting Thursday left 12 suspected Taleban militants dead in southern Nawzad district . A coalition soldier was also killed by a landmine in the same province . Burma 's official media reported Saturday that troops confiscated grenades and other weapons from a border hide-out used by suspected drug traffickers , after an earlier gunbattle killed 13 policemen and members of their patrol . Most of the world 's cases , 103 , have occurred in Indonesia . His comments come one day before the IAEA board meets in Vienna . The state-run New Light of Myanmar said the shoot-out took place February 20 near the northeastern town of Tachileik , which borders Thailand . The report said an anti-drug squad was patrolling the Mekong river near Tachileik when it encountered drug traffickers and a gunbattle broke out . Eight policemen were killed , along with two local militia members and three police boat drivers . Two police officers were wounded .

Shi'ite leaders are urging their followers not to resort to revenge attacks , but to focus on the upcoming national elections . The United Nations says that restoring tens of thousands of degraded wetlands around the world could help reduce the threat of a bird flu pandemic . Preliminary findings of the report were released Tuesday during a conference at the U.N. Environment Program headquarters in Nairobi , Kenya . The report says the loss of wetlands is forcing many wild birds into alternative habitats like farm ponds and paddy fields . It says these habitats increase the risk of the birds spreading avian flu to domestic birds like chickens . The U.N. agency says current efforts to curb the spread of the disease , like isolation or destroying birds , are likely quick fixes that offer limited short-term benefits . Bird flu has killed more than 100 people since 2003 , mostly in East Asia . The disease also has been detected in birds in parts of Africa , the Middle East and Europe . European and U.S. leaders accuse Iran of secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons . The African Union 's peace and security council has called on all African countries to impose sanctions against Togo over the military 's installation of President Faure Gnassingbe .

The United States is revitalizing efforts to jumpstart six-party talks on North Korea 's nuclear ambitions . In an interview with Reuters and AFP , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice says the United States has already made Pyongyang \" a very good proposal \" and is waiting for it to be accepted . U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice says the Bush administration has a strategy to \" assure victory \" in Iraq . North Korea has so far refused to return for a fourth round of talks , alleging the United States plans to launch military strikes against it - an idea Ms. Rice calls \" farfetched . \" Meanwhile , a senior U.S. official is in Seoul for talks with South Korean officials after stops in Tokyo and Beijing . Michael Green , director for Asian affairs on the U.S. National Security Council , says the Bush administration is holding out hope that Pyongyang will return to the negotiations . Italian chemical giant Montedison S.p.A. , through its Montedison Acquisition N.V. indirect unit , began its $ 37-a-share tender offer for all the common shares outstanding of Erbamont N.V. , a maker of pharmaceuticals incorporated in the Netherlands . The offer , advertised in today 's editions of The Wall Street Journal , is scheduled to expire at the end of November . Montedison currently owns about 72 % of Erbamont 's common shares outstanding . The offer is being launched pursuant to a previously announced agreement between the companies . Burkina Faso ( formerly Upper Volta ) achieved independence from France in 1960 . Repeated military coups during the 1970s and 1980s were followed by multiparty elections in the early 1990s . Current President Blaise COMPAORE came to power in a 1987 military coup and has won every election since then . In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , Ms. Rice said the plan is to clear out areas under insurgent control , hold those areas securely , and build durable , national Iraqi institutions . Burkina Faso 's high population density and limited natural resources result in poor economic prospects for the majority of its citizens . Recent unrest in Cote d'Ivoire and northern Ghana has hindered the ability of several hundred thousand seasonal Burkinabe farm workers to find employment in neighboring countries . Once one of the wealthiest of the Yugoslav republics , Croatia 's economy suffered badly during the 1991 - 95 war as output collapsed and the country missed the early waves of investment in Central and Eastern Europe that followed the fall of the Berlin Wall . Between 2000 and 2007 , however , Croatia 's economic fortunes began to improve slowly , with moderate but steady GDP growth between 4 % and 6 % led by a rebound in tourism and credit-driven consumer spending . Inflation over the same period has remained tame and the currency , the kuna , stable . Nevertheless , difficult problems still remain , including a stubbornly high unemployment rate , a growing trade deficit and uneven regional development . The state retains a large role in the economy , as privatization efforts often meet stiff public and political resistance . While macroeconomic stabilization has largely been achieved , structural reforms lag because of deep resistance on the part of the public and lack of strong support from politicians . The EU accession process should accelerate fiscal and structural reform . While long term growth prospects for the economy remain strong , Croatia will face significant pressure as a result of the global financial crisis . She said the United States will send in teams of diplomatic and military personnel working together to help Iraqis train police , and set up essential services . Croatia 's high foreign debt , anemic export sector , strained state budget , and over-reliance on tourism revenue will result in higher risk to economic stability over the medium term . Morocco annexed the northern two-thirds of Western Sahara ( formerly Spanish Sahara ) in 1976 and claimed the rest of the territory in 1979 , following Mauritania 's withdrawal . A guerrilla war with the Polisario Front contesting Morocco 's sovereignty ended in a 1991 UN-brokered cease-fire ; a UN-organized referendum on the territory 's final status has been repeatedly postponed . The UN since 2007 has sponsored intermittent talks between representatives of the Government of Morocco and the Polisario Front to negotiate the status of Western Sahara . Morocco has put forward an autonomy proposal for the territory , which would allow for some local administration while maintaining Moroccan sovereignty . The Polisario , with Algeria 's support , demands a popular referendum that includes the option of independence . The Genoese built a fortress on the site of present day Monaco in 1215 . The current ruling Grimaldi family first seized temporary control in 1297 , and again in 1331 , but were not able to permanently secure their holding until 1419 . Economic development was spurred in the late 19th century with a railroad linkup to France and the opening of a casino . Since then , the principality 's mild climate , splendid scenery , and gambling facilities have made Monaco world famous as a tourist and recreation center . Ms. Rice 's testimony Wednesday comes just days after Iraqis voted in a referendum on a new constitution . A CRAB , forsaking the seashore , chose a neighboring green meadow as its feeding ground . A Fox came across him , and being very hungry ate him up . Just as he was on the point of being eaten , the Crab said , \" I well deserve my fate , for what business had I on the land , when by my nature and habits I am only adapted for the sea ? ' Contentment with our lot is an element of happiness . A GROOM used to spend whole days in currycombing and rubbing down his Horse , but at the same time stole his oats and sold them for his own profit . \" Alas ! \" said the Horse , \" if you really wish me to be in good condition , you should groom me less , and feed me more . \" A POLITICAL Leader was walking out one sunny day , when he observed his Shadow leaving him and walking rapidly away . \" Come back here , you scoundrel , \" he cried . \" If I had been a scoundrel , \" answered the Shadow , increasing its speed , \" I should not have left you . \" The makers of French 's Mustard made the following recent statement : Senators pressed the secretary for specifics , including when the 150-thousand U.S. troops in Iraq might start coming home . We at the French 's Company wish to put an end to statements that our product is manufactured in France . There is no relationship , nor has there ever been a relationship , between our mustard and the country of France . Indeed , our mustard in manufactured in Rochester , NY . The only thing we have in common is that we are both yellow . At least our team is trying to win a game . Coach went out and set up our new pitching machine the other day . Unfortunately it beat us 04-Jan . Clinton 's mother prayed fervently that Bill would grow up and be president . So far , half of her prayer has been answered . Applied excessively , styling gel could cause you to have a hair-raising experience . Witnesses in Somalia say insurgents have burned and dragged the bodies of at least two soldiers through the streets of Mogadishu , after a clash between militants and Ethiopian forces killed seven people . The secretary refused to offer a timetable , saying any withdrawal depends on Iraqi forces being able to fight the insurgents independently . India says it is increasing security to thwart possible militant strikes in the country . Indian Home Minister P. Chidambaram Tuesday warned reporters against creating an alarmist picture and said India is increasing its level of preparedness to meet any terror threat or attack . The minister 's comments come just days after Israel said it has information that the same group that carried out the 2008 attacks in Mumbai , India , is planning another assault against Western and Israeli targets in the country . Israel 's counter-terrorism bureau released a statement Thursday , September 17 , saying it has information that terrorists are planning a number of attacks across India , and may be focusing on hitting groups of Israelis and Westerners . India is a popular destination for Israeli tourists , especially during Jewish festivals such as the traditional new year , which began Friday . The United States , Israel and Australia have issued travel advisories to their citizens . India 's holiday season includes Hindu , Islamic and secular holidays , as well as the period surrounding the commemoration of the September 11 , 2001 terror attacks on the United States . Ugandan 's president says his country could increase the number of troops it has in Somalia as part of the African Union peacekeeping force . In a statement Thursday , President Yoweri Museveni says Uganda is \" capable \" of providing all 8,000 troops authorized for the force by the AU . The statement says he made the comment to United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon on Wednesday , on the sidelines of the AU summit in Ethiopia . English and Irish colonists from St. Kitts first settled on Montserrat in 1632 ; the first African slaves arrived three decades later . Mr. Museveni told the U.N. leader he has to discuss the matter with his High Command first but will inform Mr. Ban of the decision . Uganda and Burundi have deployed a total of about 2,000 troops to Somalia , where the Somali government and allied Ethiopian troops have been battling an Islamist-led insurgency for more than a year . Fighting centered in Mogadishu has killed thousands of people and prompted more than 6,00,000 others to flee the city . Mr. Ban has expressed concern that few African countries have fulfilled their promise of troops for the AU peacekeeping froce . Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe named an electoral commission to run parliamentary elections expected in March . The main opposition , Movement for Democratic Change said it had no confidence in the commission . Justice minister Patrick Chinamasa announced that Mr. Mugabe appointed a 5-member body under the chairmanship of High Court Judge , George Chiweshe , who was appointed by President Robert Mugabe , leader of Zimbabwe 's ruling Zanu-PF party . Judge Chiweshe made legal history in 2002 when he told the High Court that the state did not have to provide any evidence to continue to detain a critically ill opposition member of parliament who was trying to get out of prison on bail . He was also appointed by Mr. Mugabe to draw up a new map of voting districts released before Christmas . The MDC expressed concerns over Mr. Chiweshe 's appointment because of the voter redistricting which removed three of the MDC 's stronghold constituencies . The British and French fought for possession of the island for most of the 18th century , but it finally was confirmed as a British possession in 1783 . Mr. Chinamasa insisted that the commission reflects an all-inclusive consultation process , incorporating all three parties represented in Zimbabwe 's parliament , including the MDC . But , new electoral laws signed into law by Mr. Mugabe last week , for the first time give the military , police and prison officials a substantial role in the next poll , and they can , if recruited to serve , control voting and counting . There was a frenzy of lawmaking late last year to establish new legislation and electoral authorities ahead of the poll which Mr. Mugabe says will be held in March ahead of his 25th anniversary of coming to power in 1980 . The MDC suspended participation in all elections five months ago because it said the electoral playing field was uneven . It said it would only take part when Zimbabwe 's laws and practice complied with regional electoral principles agreed to by Mr. Mugabe and other southern African countries last August . However most political analysts believe the MDC will take part in the general election , despite Zimbabwe 's lack of compliance with regional electoral practices and laws . Western observers are not expected to be invited to cover Zimbabwe 's poll as they said the last two national elections were neither free nor fair . In a weekend of second-round qualifiers for the 2012 African Cup of Nations , no result was more surprising than Niger 's 1-0 upset of reigning African champions Egypt . Football fans in Niger 's capital celebrated throughout the night , blowing horns and singing the praises of their Menas ' win over the Pharaohs of Egypt . It was a stunning upset , even for the most loyal of Niger 's football faithful . The island 's sugar plantation economy was converted to small farm landholdings in the mid 19th century . FIFA ranks Egypt 9th in the world . Niger : 154th . Niamey 's 35,000 seat Stade Général Seyni Kountché was full long before the mid-afternoon kick-off under a blistering sun . Striker Ouwa Moussa Maazou scored the only goal in the first half , getting past Egyptian defender Mohamed Abel Shafy who failed to clear . Goalkeeper Essam el-Hadary charged Maazou , but the 22-year-old striker - who is on loan from French club Bordeaux - slipped the ball past him into the net . Egypt pressed for the equalizer at the start of the second half , but rarely got much past midfield . Their best chance came off a free kick in the 76th minute . But Mahmoud Fathallah was ruled offside . Maazou 's goal and solid defense gives Niger three points in Group G and drops Egypt to the bottom of the group with only one point after two matches , following their opening 01-Jan draw with Sierra Leone in Cairo . It was an inauspicious start for the record seven-time continental champions , who next play South Africa in Johannesburg . Much of this island was devastated and two-thirds of the population fled abroad because of the eruption of the Soufriere Hills Volcano that began on 18 July 1995 . Niger hosts Sierra Leone as it pushes to qualify for the 2012 tournament in Equatorial Guinea and Gabon . Iraqi officials say a car bomb targeting a police patrol has killed six people and wounded at least 11 more in a city north of Baghdad . Police said Thursday the blast took place in central Tikrit , hometown of former dictator Saddam Hussein . They said four police officers were among the dead and several others were wounded . Overall violence in Iraq has yet to match the peak reached in 2006 and 2007 . However , insurgents have intensified attacks since inconclusive March elections left the country without a governing coalition . Sylvester Stallone faces stiff fines in Australia , where he is accused of importing a muscle-building hormone . The movie star was detained Feb. 16 in the Sydney airport , while authorities searched his hotel room . He and his group subsequently left the country , and he was not compelled to attend the March 13 hearing . He is accused of possessing human growth hormone , classified in Australia as a restricted performance-enhancing drug . Montserrat has endured volcanic activity since , with the last eruption occurring in July 2003 . The maximum penalty for illegal possession is a fine of $ 86,000 and five years in prison . Stallone is unlikely to face such a sentence . Police in western India say at least 52 people were killed and at least eight others injured Thursday , when a train collided with a tractor carrying a wedding party . Police say the accident happened in a small village in Maharashtra state , some 800 kilometers northeast of Bombay , also known as Mumbai . They say a local train bound for the central city of Nagpur smashed into a tractor as it was crossing the tracks . Accidents are relatively frequent on India 's railway network , which handles 13 million passengers on 14,000 trains every day . In December , a head-on collision of two passenger trains in Punjab state brought opposition party calls for the resignation of Railways Minister Laloo Prasad Yadav . At least 37 people died in that crash . The New York City Fire Department has released thousands of pages of oral histories and hours of radio transmissions from the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center . A New York State court of appeals ruled in March that the items must be made public . Georgia 's economy sustained GDP growth of more than 10 % in 2006 - 7 , based on strong inflows of foreign investment and robust government spending . The oral histories were complied by firefighters shortly after the attacks on the twin towers , and include accounts from firefighters and emergency medical personnel who were on the scene . The New York Times newspaper and families of the victims of the attacks had sued for the release of the material . The city had said it wanted to protect the privacy of those involved , and not jeopardize the case against Zacarias Moussaoui , who later pleaded guilty to conspiring with the hijackers . The United Nations says the December 26 Indian Ocean tsunami dumped tons of hazardous waste on the shores of Somalia . A spokesman for the U.N. Environment Program says containers filled with nuclear , chemical and medical waste broke apart when they washed ashore , and have been spread by the weather . The spokesman says there have been reports from northern Somalia of illnesses consistent with radiation sickness , including respiratory infections , mouth ulcers , abdominal hemorrhages and unusual skin diseases . The United Nations says foreign companies , many from Europe , began dumping toxic waste on Somalia 's shore in the 1980s , but the practice accelerated after the 1991 overthrow of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre . The tsunami is believed to have dislodged the hazardous materials . Japan has pledged $ 17 billion in development aid to other Asian countries for infrastructure projects that will help boost growth . Speaking Saturday to the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso also repeated a pledge to lend $ 100 billion to the International Monetary Fund . However , GDP growth slowed in 2008 following the August 2008 conflict with Russia , and turned negative in 2009 as foreign direct investment and workers ' remittances declined in the wake of the global financial crisis , but rebounded in 2010 .

More than 5,000 U.S. , Iraqi and British troops have swept through an Iraqi town south of Baghdad in the latest operation against insurgents ahead of January elections . The U.S. military says troops arrested 32 suspected insurgents in Jabella Tuesday . The raid follows operations in Fallujah and the northern city of Mosul . U.S. Defense Minister Donald Rumsfeld says those operations show how much insurgents are opposed to a democratic Iraq . He warned that attacks will likely increase ahead of the elections . Meanwhile , foreign ministers from Arab and Western countries met Tuesday in Egypt and said full participation in the vote is the key to reconciliation in Iraq . In another development , a Sunni Muslim cleric was gunned down outside a mosque north of Baghdad . Terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden apparently has surfaced on an audiotape calling for the overthrow of Saudi Arabia 's government . Georgia 's main economic activities include the cultivation of agricultural products such as grapes , citrus fruits , and hazelnuts ; mining of manganese and copper ; and output of a small industrial sector producing alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages , metals , machinery , aircraft and chemicals . The lengthy message criticizes the Saudi monarchy , saying its attempts at reform will not change anything and that change will only come through armed struggle and the government 's overthrow . Authorities say the authenticity of the tape , which surfaced Thursday on an Islamist website , could not immediately be verified . He also praises the militants who attacked the U.S. consulate in the Saudi city of Jeddah earlier this month , asking God to be merciful on them . Four of the attackers were killed , a fifth was arrested . Five consulate staff members who were not American were also killed . Osama bin Laden remains a fugitive . He was last heard from in a videotape shortly before the U.S. presidential elections last month . The U.S.-led military forces in Afghanistan say more than a dozen militants were killed in a day-long battle in southern part of the country Saturday . A coalition and an Afghan soldier were also killed in the fighting . Saturday 's fighting took place in southern Helmand province . Areas of recent improvement include growth in the construction , banking services , and mining sectors , but reduced availability of external investment and the slowing regional economy are emerging risks . Coalition and Afghan forces called for air strikes on militant positions after coming under attack in the area . Also in the south , Taleban militants executed the kidnapped son of a district police chief . The victim was reported to be between 14 and 18-years-old . In other violence , a roadside bomb hit an Afghan army convoy killing at least two soldiers and wounding three others in the western Farah province on Sunday . A Taleban spokesperson has taken responsibility for the deadly blast . The World Food Program ( WFP ) warns that fighting in Chad could leave up to 7,00,000 people short of food . The U.N. agency expressed concern that violence will delay truck convoys trying to reach refugees in eastern Chad and displaced people in Sudan 's Darfur region . The agency says the trucks must get through before the end of next month , when seasonal rains are expected to make road travel impossible . Chad 's government is fighting an insurgency that President Idriss Deby says is backed by Sudan . The Sudanese government denies the charge . The violence erupted Wednesday after insurgents attacked Ethiopian tanks rolling through an insurgent stronghold near the headquarters of the former Defense Ministry in southern Mogadishu . The country imports nearly all its needed supplies of natural gas and oil products . The World Food Program says it remains operational in Chad despite recent clashes that led it to evacuate non-essential staff . The agency says it is wrapping up April food distribution in eastern Chad , where it looks after some 2,00,000 refugees from Darfur . The agency feeds another 5,00,000 displaced Sudanese in Darfur itself . Police in the northeastern U.S. state of Connecticut say a disgruntled employee at a beer distribution firm went on a shooting spree at his place of employment , leaving nine people dead including himself . A labor union official says the suspect was a driver who had worked at the company , Hartford Distributors . He apparently went on a rampage Tuesday , after being summoned for a disciplinary hearing . The shooting took place at 7.30 in the morning at a company warehouse , while a large number of people were inside the building during a shift change . Police say , after the rampage , it appears the gunman shot and killed himself . Afghan officials are welcoming the Netherlands ' decision to keep its troops in southern Afghanistan , but the officials say the international community must do more to equip domestic forces . Afghan Defense Ministry officials Saturday said the extension of the Dutch mission is a positive step . It has sizeable hydropower capacity , a growing component of its energy supplies . But they said further training of Afghan troops is necessary to ensure long-term security in Afghanistan . The Dutch government announced Friday it will extend the mandate of its troops until 2010 . The soldiers serve as part of a NATO force . Around 1,700 Dutch troops have been deployed in the southern Uruzgan province , where NATO and U.S.-led forces are fighting fierce battles against Taliban militants . A renewed Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan has turned this year into the deadliest yet since the 2001 U.S.-led invasion ousted the Taliban government . The prime minister of Pakistan , Shaukat Aziz , has called for European help in repatriating three million Afghan refugees in his country . Mr. Aziz says refugee camps along the border with Afghanistan provide safe havens for terrorists . The prime minister also promised to strengthen efforts to restrict cross-border attacks into Afghanistan . The Pakistan government has proposed a controversial plan to fence and mine parts of the mountainous border . Mr. Aziz is in Belgium , holding talks with European Union and NATO leaders . Georgia has overcome the chronic energy shortages and gas supply interruptions of the past by renovating hydropower plants and by increasingly relying on natural gas imports from Azerbaijan instead of from Russia . After Tuesday 's meeting , NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer called for an end to criticism of Pakistan 's efforts to contain militants . Scheffer said it does not make sense to have a public \" blame game . \" The Afghan government and the United States have both accused Pakistan of failing to clamp down on Taleban insurgents based in Pakistan who launch attacks into Afghanistan . Police in Indonesia have asked churches to prepare for possible Christmas attacks by digging holes for suspicious objects that might be bombs . Officials in the central Java city of Solo said Friday they are requesting churches put any suspicious object into a one-meter deep hole to store until a bomb squad can arrive . Earlier this month , Jakarta 's police chief said he will deploy up to 17,000 security officers to safeguard the Indonesian capital during the upcoming Christian holiday season . Five years ago , militants bombed 11 churches on Christmas Eve , killing 19 people . Police suspect the radical Jemaah Islamiyah group was responsible . Shops , businesses , and offices were shut in Indian-controlled Kashmir Monday , after separatists called a strike to protest the death of a teenager . Seventeen-year-old Tufail Ahmad Matoo was killed in the main town of Srinagar Friday during clashes between anti-India protesters and police . The construction on the Baku-T'bilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline , the Baku-T'bilisi-Erzerum gas pipeline , and the Kars-Akhalkalaki Railroad are part of a strategy to capitalize on Georgia 's strategic location between Europe and Asia and develop its role as a transit point for gas , oil and other goods . Residents say Mattoo was hit by a teargas shell fired by police and was carrying a school bag when he was hit . Police say they are investigating the death . Clashes between demonstrators and security forces have erupted in Srinagar since the incident , with strict security restrictions in place to prevent further violence . Kashmiri Muslim separatists have been fighting for two decades for independence from India or a merger with Muslim-majority Pakistan . The insurgency has killed more than 47,000 people . Kashmir is divided between India and Pakistan , but claimed in its entirety by both . The neighbors have fought two wars over the region . Hundreds of millions of Christians worldwide are celebrating Christmas Saturday . Pope John Paul , in his traditional Christmas Day message , expressed concern at violence in the Middle East and Africa . The Roman Catholic pontiff said he follows the situation in Iraq with \" great apprehension . \" Georgia has historically suffered from a chronic failure to collect tax revenues ; however , the government , since coming to power in 2004 , has simplified the tax code , improved tax administration , increased tax enforcement , and cracked down on petty corruption . He said he has \" anxious concern \" about the situation in the Holy Land but also feels \" invincible confidence \" at the prospects for peace there . President Bush issued a Christmas Day call for Americans to volunteer to help the neediest of their fellow citizens . The President also acknowledged Americans serving in Afghanistan , Iraq and elsewhere around the world .

Russian President Vladimir Putin attended a Christmas Eve service at a cathedral in the Siberian city of Yakutsk . In a message to citizens , Mr. Putin urged them to follow the Christmas tradition of helping those in need . However , the economic downturn of 2008 - 9 eroded the tax base and led to a decline in the budget surplus and an increase in public borrowing needs . In Rome , Pope Benedict extended Christmas greetings to Orthodox Christians as Roman Catholics marked the feast of the Epiphany - the Three Kings or Wise Men who tradition says brought gifts to Jesus following his birth . Many Orthodox churches celebrate Christmas on the Julian calendar - about two weeks later than most other Christians . The Indian foreign ministry says India and Pakistan will hold the first meeting of a joint anti-terrorism panel in March . The talks will be held in Pakistan 's capital , Islamabad , on March 6 . The idea for the panel was first proposed last year during a meeting in Cuba between Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf . The initiative was created after deadly train bombings in Mumbai in July . India claimed Pakistan 's top intelligence agency ( ISI ) played a role in the attack , a charged denied by Pakistan . Efforts to improve relations between India and Pakistan began with a peace process in 2004 . The two countries have fought three wars and have yet to resolve their dispute over the region of Kashmir , where an anti-India insurgency has killed tens of thousands since 1989 . World number-two men 's tennis player Rafael Nadal of Spain has withdrawn from the season 's first Grand Slam tournament , the Australian Open , which begins Monday in Melbourne . The country is pinning its hopes for renewed growth on a determined effort to continue to liberalize the economy by reducing regulation , taxes , and corruption in order to attract foreign investment , but the economy faces a more difficult investment climate both domestically and internationally . The 19-year-old French Open champion said on his website Tuesday that he would be unable to play because of a foot injury he suffered in October at the Madrid Masters . He has not played a tour event since . Nadal joins American Andre Agassi on the sidelines for the tournament , which could still lose Russians Marat Safin and Maria Sharapova because of fitness doubts . But top men 's seed and world number-one Roger Federer of Switzerland says he is in good form heading into the event and is fully recovered from the ankle injury that hampered him last season . U.S. officials say Pakistan and Afghanistan must decide for themselves on an appropriate and effective method of reducing cross-border infiltration . In an interview with VOA Wednesday the U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs , Nicholas Burns , said Pakistan 's plan to lay land mines along parts of its border with Afghanistan is a bilateral issue . Afghan officials have opposed the plan , saying it will do little to prevent terrorism . Afghanistan has repeatedly accused Pakistan of not doing enough to stop Taleban militants from infiltrating their shared border . Burns also said he hopes the two sides can resolve a wave of Taleban-led attacks on civilians and NATO forces inside Afghanistan . Fighting in Afghanistan increased dramatically last year , killing thousands and igniting tensions between Kabul and Islamabad . After discarding socialist economic policies in the mid-1990s , Madagascar followed a World Bank- and IMF-led policy of privatization and liberalization that has been undermined since the start of the political crisis . European Union Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson says EU trading partners are not ready to make what he calls the \" hard decisions \" needed for a world trade deal . Monday , Mandelson made his first speech to the European Parliament since last month 's World Trade Organization meeting ended with little progress . He said Hong Kong and other major European trading partners are not yet prepared to make the concessions needed to bring talks to a successful conclusion in 2006 . Mandelson said he will do what he can to meet a deadline for a deal , but not at Europe 's expense . The EU says it has made significant compromises on such issues as farm subsidies to open its market to agricultural imports . The United States and other countries say the E.U . has not gone far enough . Cyprus Foreign Minister George Iacovou says his European Union counterparts have agreed on a statement responding to Turkey 's refusal to recognize the internationally backed Cypriot government . Mr. Iacovou gave no details of the statement . But he told the Cyprus News Agency the ministers left it up to ambassadors of the 25 EU countries to work out the final text of the document . Earlier , Turkey 's Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul warned his country will abandon its EU membership bid if the bloc imposes new conditions on Ankara , or tries to offer anything less than full membership . This strategy placed the country on a slow and steady growth path from an extremely low level . Turkey has insisted that recognition of the Greek-led Cypriot government depends on a resolution of the three-decade division of Cyprus . EU ministers have been pressing Turkey to normalize relations with all EU members , including Cyprus . Turkey is scheduled to start EU membership talks next month . The U.S. military in Afghanistan says four American soldiers and an Afghan interpreter have been wounded in a roadside explosion in a southeastern part of the country . A statement said the explosion occurred during a routine patrol near the town of Ghazni Tuesday . It said initial medical assessments indicated none of the wounds were life-threatening . On Monday , four American soldiers were wounded when a suicide bomber rammed his explosives-laden car into a U.S. military vehicle near the southern city of Kandahar . Taleban insurgents claimed responsibility for that attack . Meanwhile , the military said coalition forces killed two insurgents and detained 12 others after a brief firefight near Kandahar Sunday . In recent weeks , the guerrillas have stepped up their attacks in southern and eastern Afghanistan , as the country prepares for parliamentary elections expected in September . Agriculture , including fishing and forestry , is a mainstay of the economy , accounting for more than one-fourth of GDP and employing 80 % of the population . A group of Iraqi lawmakers loyal to Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr has staged a protest against a proposal allowing British troops to remain in the country . The Sadrist politicians walked out of a session of parliament Saturday , suspending consideration of the proposal . The deal would allow up to 100 British troops to stay in Iraq beyond a previously approved withdrawal date . They would be responsible for helping the Iraqi navy protect oil installations off the southern coast . Moqtada al-Sadr has been a vocal and influential critic of the foreign military presence in Iraq , led by the United States . U.S. troops withdrew from Iraqi cities at the end of June , transferring security responsibilities to Iraqi forces . Since then , there have been a several deadly bombings across the country . A car bomb Saturday in a Shi'ite district near Mosul killed four people and wounded at least 35 others . Chinese National Basketball Association All-Star center Yao Ming will be on the sidelines for several games because of a sore right big toe . The Houston Rockets star missed his first game of the season and the third of his NBA career on Sunday . Witnesses say the Ethiopian troops returned heavy fire and that several people were wounded in the fighting . Exports of apparel have boomed in recent years primarily due to duty-free access to the US . Team officials say the injury will keep Yao off the court indefinitely . The 25-year-old center has played in 266 regular-season games since joining the Rockets in 2002 . He has had a problem with his toe for some time , forcing him to miss two pre-season games . Yao is the leading vote-getter after the first set of returns for this season 's All-Star game . He is averaging 19.9 points per game , nine rebounds and 1.36 blocked shots . Italian police have arrested 40 people linked to Islamic groups in nationwide raids as part of a security crackdown . Authorities say 28 of the detainees were charged with violating rules on residence permits and 12 with other minor offenses . But they said none face terrorism charges . Officials say they also issued 114 expulsion orders as part of the same operation . The raids focused on Islamic gathering places , including telephone call centers , Internet cafes and offices for sending cash abroad . However , Madagascar 's failure to comply with the requirements of the African Growth and Opportunity Act ( AGOA ) led to the termination of the country 's duty-free access in January 2010 . Officers also raided 15 apartments , mostly those of Pakistanis , in cooperation with a Belgian police investigation into suspected financing of terrorist groups . The raids , Thursday and Friday , followed Thursday 's arrest in Britain of 24 people suspected in an alleged plot to blow up U.S.-bound airliners over the Atlantic Ocean . Tens of thousands of anti-government demonstrators have marched on the main government offices in Thailand 's capital , Bangkok . Some 30,000 protesters marched through the city for two hours , urging the government to dissolve parliament and punish those responsible for last year 's crippling protests . The earlier demonstrations ousted current Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva 's pro-Thaksin predecessor Somchai Wongsawat . Before dispersing , the demonstrators promised to make their protest permanent , if their demands are not met within 15 days . More than 5,000 police were deployed to secure the mass protest , which ran from Saturday afternoon into early Sunday . Last year , yellow-shirted protesters occupied Government House for about three months , and shut down major airports before a coup ousted the government . Thailand has been wracked by political unrest for years . The country is sharply divided between groups who favor and oppose Mr. Thaksin , who was ousted in a coup in 2006 . Deforestation and erosion , aggravated by the use of firewood as the primary source of fuel , are serious concerns . In Liberia , supporters of former soccer star George Weah have vowed to continue their protests of the November 8 presidential run-off election , which they say was fraudulent .

The Hubble Space Telescope is back to work , after a month-long shutdown to fix problems it was having in sending information to Earth . The U.S. space agency , NASA , said Thursday the telescope 's camera is now working as it was before the problems . The agency said it took a photo of a pair of galaxies and that it \" scored a perfect 10 \" . The photo shows the ring-shaped galaxies just after they collided . The Hubble stopped beaming information to Earth in late September when a data unit failed . The computer glitch forced NASA to postpone a shuttle mission to repair the Hubble . That mission has been rescheduled for next year . Former President RAVALOMANANA worked aggressively to revive the economy following the 2002 political crisis , which triggered a 12 % drop in GDP that year . The Hubble has been orbiting about 600 kilometers above the Earth since 1990 . The telescope sends images from space back to Earth and has revolutionized understanding of the universe . Armed militants briefly occupied the West Bank headquarters of the Palestinian Cabinet Thursday , in a protest against the territory 's new Hamas-led government . Palestinian authorities say about 20 militants from the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades forced their way into the cabinet offices Thursday in Ramallah , the administrative headquarters of the Palestinian Authority . The gunmen stayed for about an hour , before they were persuaded to leave by a police contingent that arrived at the scene . Al Aqsa Martyrs ' Brigades is a militant faction of Fatah , and the security forces at the scene were also under the control of Fatah leader and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas . A suicide bomber tried to kill the leader of Iraq 's most powerful Shi'ite political group Monday while the main Sunni party withdrew from the country 's January 30th election . Abdul Aziz al-Hakim , whose United Iraqi Alliance is expected to dominate the vote , survived the Baghdad attack . But at least 13 people were killed . Earlier in the day , the Sunni Iraqi Islamic Party pulled out of the vote because of concerns over violence . The current political crisis which began in early 2009 has dealt additional blows to the economy . The party says more time is needed to ensure that all Shi'ites and Sunnis participate in the election . In other election news , a new audiotape purportedly from Osama bin Laden calls for Iraqis to boycott the vote , saying those who take part will be infidels .

Richardson , the nation 's only Hispanic governor , was energy secretary under former President Bill Clinton and was also an ambassador to the United Nations . Recent opinion polls indicate that Hispanics have tended to support Obama 's Democratic rival , Senator Hillary Clinton . Obama currently leads among delegates selected at Democratic primaries and caucuses . Tourism dropped more than 50 % in 2009 , compared with the previous year , and many investors are wary of entering the uncertain investment environment . The next major primary is to take place in Pennsylvania next month - April 22 . Some 6,00,000 revelers are expected to pack Rio de Janeiro over the next few days , as the Brazilian city celebrates the annual Carnival before Lent - the Christian season of repentance . Rio celebrates Carnival with parades featuring the sensual Brazilian dance known as the samba . The celebration culminates Sunday and Monday with a giant samba competition in the city 's 60,000-seat Sambadrome stadium . Outside the Sambadrome , Brazilians and tourists extend the party into the streets , wearing outlandish costumes and masks and eating and drinking to excess . Similar celebrations take place in New Orleans in the United States , and in many parts of Europe , as people of the Christian faith squeeze in a last few days of indulgence before beginning six weeks of fasting and prayer . A Palestinian court has sentenced a man to death by hanging for selling West Bank land to Israeli citizens . The sentence was handed down Tuesday by a court in the West Bank town of Hebron , but it may be unlikely to be carried out . Prosecutors say the defendant sold to Israelis land that did not belong to him in the village of Beit Omar near Hebron . The Palestinian Authority considers the sale of Palestinian land to Israelis to be treason . Settled by both Britain and France during the first half of the 19th century , the island was made a French possession in 1853 . Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas must approve the sentence for it to be carried out . He has withheld approval in many other death penalty cases . Several other Palestinians charged with collaborating with Israel are currently on death row . The Arabic television station al-Jazeera has broadcast a videotape of al-Qaida 's second in command , Ayman al-Zawahri , who vowed to keep fighting the United States unless Washington changes its policies towards the Muslim world . In excerpts of the video aired Monday , Osama bin Laden 's deputy said al-Qaida was not concerned with the results of the U.S. presidential election .

The head of the U.S. central bank signaled Tuesday that interest rates are not likely to be cut anytime soon . Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said interest rate policies and efforts to stimulate the faltering U.S. economy are \" well positioned \" to promote growth and stable prices . The Fed has been cutting interest rates steadily to boost economic growth . It served as a penal colony for four decades after 1864 . But officials must balance the need to boost the economy with the concern that cutting interest rates too low could spark inflation . Inflation concerns have been rising along with the price of oil . Fuel price hikes are also forcing the biggest U.S. automaker to slash truck production and make more small , fuel-efficient cars . General Motors Tuesday announced that it will close four North American plants that make trucks . Russian authorities have detained a man suspected of being involved in the deadly school siege in the southern town of Beslan . Officials in Moscow Wednesday said the man was arrested by security forces in Ingushetia , near the North Ossetia region where the attack took place . They say there is also information the man took part in an armed attack targeting police facilities in Ingushetia last June . Militants attacked one of Beslan 's schools last September , seizing more than 1,000 children , parents and teachers . The ordeal ended in a chaotic outburst of gunfire and explosions that killed more than 330 people , about half of them children . Red Cross officials in Kabul say suspects detained by U.S. troops in Afghanistan have been allowed to speak with family members through a new video-teleconference system . Agitation for independence during the 1980s and early 1990s ended in the 1998 Noumea Accord , which over a period of 15 to 20 years will transfer an increasing amount of governing responsibility from France to New Caledonia . Officials said Monday , that about 60 families have so far taken advantage of the opportunity to speak with prisoners held at the detention center on the U.S. Bagram Air Force Base . Many families have not spoken to their detained relatives for several years . Around 600 detainees are being held at the facility . The International Committee of the Red Cross helped organize the initiative , which is the first of its kind . Since the 2001 U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan , hundreds of Taliban and al-Qaida suspects have been detained , along with others accused of terrorist activities . The U.S. Senate is to begin debate Wednesday on one of President Bush 's judicial nominees - setting the stage for a possible showdown on the delaying tactic known as a filibuster . The leader of the Republican majority in the Senate , Bill Frist , plans to bring to the Senate floor Mr. Bush 's nomination of Priscilla Owen . A Texas Supreme Court justice , Ms. Owen was one of seven nominees blocked by Democrats during the president 's first term . If Democrats are successful again , Republicans say they will seek early next week to change Senate rules to limit filibusters , a parliamentary delaying procedure aimed at preventing a vote . Opposition Democrats say changing Senate rules would drastically curtail the rights of the minority . The agreement also commits France to conduct a referendum between 2014 and 2019 to decide whether New Caledonia should assume full sovereignty and independence . Talks seeking a compromise have not been successful . The largest Sunni bloc in Iraq 's parliament has suspended its participation in the government and is threatening to withdraw completely . The Accordance Front Wednesday , gave Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki one week to meet its demands to deal with Shi'ite militias and reform the conduct of raids and arrests . The bloc has been boycotting cabinet meetings since June to protest legal proceedings against Culture Minister Asad Kamal al-Hashimi . Al-Hashimi has been accused of arranging to have another politician killed . Last week , the Accordance Front and a group of Shi'ite lawmakers ended a boycott of Iraq 's parliament . Also Tuesday , Baghdad police say at least six people were killed when U.S. and Iraqi forces clashed with Shi'ite militias in the Sadr City neighborhood . And the U.S. military says it has detained the administrative head of al-Qaida in Iraq 's Mosul operations during early morning raids . The world 's largest maker of jetliners , Airbus , says it sold more planes than rival Boeing last year . Tuesday 's announcement surprised some analysts who thought Boeing might regain the sales lead . Ethiopia deployed soldiers to Somalia last December to help the interim government push an Islamist movement from power . ALL the Goods were once driven out by the Ills from that common share which they each had in the affairs of mankind ; for the Ills by reason of their numbers had prevailed to possess the earth . Airbus says it has firm orders for a record 1055 planes , while Boeing has orders for 1002 , which is a record for the company . Boeing 's orders include more wide-body planes , so at list prices , its orders are worth somewhat more than Airbus . Orders for jetliners soared in 2005 , as Asian airlines expanded their fleets to meet growing demand , and other airlines sought new , more fuel-efficient planes to cope with high oil costs . U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates is in Pakistan to discuss counter-terrorism efforts and the Taleban insurgency in neighboring Afghanistan . Gates arrived in the capital , Islamabad , Monday to meet with Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf . Washington has been putting pressure on General Musharraf to stop Taleban fighters from crossing into Afghanistan . Gates just finished four days of meetings in Spain and Germany focused largely on the war in Afghanistan . Pakistan 's foreign minister , Khursheed Kasuri , recently said the government has decided against mining its border with Afghanistan , but still intends to build a fence along parts of it . On Sunday , the governor of southern Afghanistan 's Helmand province said 700 foreign fighters , including Pakistanis , are in the region to help Taleban insurgents . A U.N. court begins hearing testimony Monday in the case of a well-known Rwandan musician accused of using his music to spread ethnic hatred during the country 's 1994 genocide . The Goods wafted themselves to heaven and asked for a righteous vengeance on their persecutors . Simon Bikindi , a musician and former official in Rwanda 's Ministry of Youth and Sports , faces six counts of genocide from the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda . He has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges from the Tanzania-based court . Prosecutors say Bikindi composed and recorded songs that encouraged Hutus to kill Tutsis . They say he consulted with former Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana over song lyrics before passing them on to a privately owned station that broadcast anti-Tutsi propaganda . Bikindi was arrested in the Netherlands in 2001 . A police chief in western Iraq says the country began stationing thousands of extra security officers along Iraq 's border with Syria this week in an effort to keep out insurgents . The chief , Major-General Tariq Youssef , said Friday that Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki ordered the reinforcements , in the wake of August truck bombings in Baghdad that killed more than 100 people . The Iraqi government has linked the blasts to Baathist sympathizers located in Syria . Syria has demanded Iraqi authorities provide evidence to back up their allegations . Iraq has also demanded that Syria hand over two people that Baghdad suspects played a role in the attacks . They entreated Jupiter that they might no longer be associated with the Ills , as they had nothing in common and could not live together , but were engaged in unceasing warfare ; and that an indissoluble law might be laid down for their future protection . Syria has refused , demanding proof . The bombings have soured relations between Iraq and Syria . Turkey has been holding talks aimed at defusing tensions between the two countries . Venezuelan officials say they are investigating allegations that military officers passed state secrets to the United States . The nation 's Military Attorney General 's Office told El~Universal newspaper Thursday that it has launched a probe of the alleged spies , although it would not say how many suspects there were . Venezuela 's Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel said Wednesday that several low-level military officers were caught passing information to the U.S. military . He said some of the suspects have been detained and others have left the country . The attorney for one of the suspects told reporters a U.S. military attaché , identified as John Correa , has been mentioned as a possible link between the Venezuelan officers and the United States . The U.S. embassy in Caracas had no comment . An Israeli newspaper reports the filmmaker whose documentary sparked an outrage in Egypt has admitted that he mistakenly identified 250 Palestinian fighters as Egyptian prisoners , who he claimed were killed by Israeli troops during the 1967 Six-Day War . Jupiter granted their request and decreed that henceforth the Ills should visit the earth in company with each other , but that the Goods should one by one enter the habitations of men . The Jerusalem Post says the filmmaker Ran Edelist also admitted using incorrect archival footage to illustrate the incident . Since the documentary was aired last week , Israel repeatedly denied that its soldiers killed Egyptian prisoners during the war . Israel also agreed to hand over a copy of the film and its transcript to Egypt . However , Egypt asked for an investigation . And , an Egyptian parliamentary committee has threatened to review economic relations and agreements with Israel if the incident is not investigated . Because of rising tensions over the film , Israeli Cabinet Minister Benjamin Ben-Eliezer earlier this week postponed a scheduled visit to Egypt . Ben-Eliezer commanded the military unit at the center of the controversy . U.S. Olympic Committee chairman Peter Ueberroth is calling on the U.S. government to reverse a decision to deny Cuba 's national baseball team permission to play in the United States . Last week , the Treasury Department denied a permit for Cuba to play in the inaugural 16-team World Baseball Classic in March . Ueberroth says the decision will damage American efforts to host the Olympics in the future . Hence it arises that Ills abound , for they come not one by one , but in troops , and by no means singly : while the Goods proceed from Jupiter , and are given , not alike to all , but singly , and separately ; and one by one to those who are able to discern them . Olympic host countries must guarantee all nations can participate . Cuba had been set to play against Puerto Rico , Panama and the Netherlands in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico in the first round . A permit from the Treasury Department 's Office of Foreign Assets Control is necessary because of U.S. laws governing certain commercial transactions with the communist island nation . Iraqi officials say a senior Interior Ministry official has been shot and killed in Baghdad . The assassination occurred Tuesday . Reuters news agency says the group led by Jordanian terrorist leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi claimed responsibility for the killing .

Belgium became independent from the Netherlands in 1830 ; it was occupied by Germany during World Wars I and II . The country prospered in the past half century as a modern , technologically advanced European state and member of NATO and the EU . Tensions between the Dutch-speaking Flemings of the north and the French-speaking Walloons of the south have led in recent years to constitutional amendments granting these regions formal recognition and autonomy . Turkmenistan is largely a desert country with intensive agriculture in irrigated oases and sizeable gas and oil resources . Also removed were A.J. Tabaldo and Leslie Hunt , who both sang Nina Simone 's \" Feeling Good \" . The two largest crops are cotton , most of which is produced for export , and wheat , which is domestically consumed . Although agriculture accounts for roughly 10 % of GDP , it continues to employ nearly half of the country 's workforce . With an authoritarian ex-Communist regime in power and a tribally based social structure , Turkmenistan has taken a cautious approach to economic reform , hoping to use gas and cotton export revenues to sustain its inefficient economy . Privatization goals remain limited . From 1998 - 2005 , Turkmenistan suffered from the continued lack of adequate export routes for natural gas and from obligations on extensive short-term external debt . At the same time , however , total exports rose by an average of roughly 15 % per year from 2003 - 8 , largely because of higher international oil and gas prices . New pipelines to China and Iran , that began operation in early 2010 , have given Turkmenistan additional export routes for its gas , although these new routes have not offset the sharp drop in export revenue since early 2009 from decreased gas exports to Russia . Overall prospects in the near future are discouraging because of widespread internal poverty , endemic corruption , a poor educational system , government misuse of oil and gas revenues , and Ashgabat 's reluctance to adopt market-oriented reforms .

Some African heads of state plan to push for a united continent during an African Union summit that begins Sunday in the Ghanaian capital of Accra . The three-day summit agenda is almost entirely dedicated to the idea of a United States of Africa . Proponents of the plan argue that a united federation of African nations could exercise more influence and better address problems facing the world 's poorest continent . Although several countries support the idea of a united continent , some regional powers like South Africa favor a more gradual consolidation of regional economic groups . The Khartoum government and Darfur 's main rebel group signed a peace deal May fifth to end fighting that has killed more than 2,00,000 people and displaced more than 2.5 million others since 2003 . Leaders at the summit will also discuss the conflicts in Darfur and Zimbabwe . The idea of a united Africa was conceived four decades ago by Ghana 's first president , Kwame Nkrumah . Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has renewed Tokyo 's call for a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council . Mr. Koizumi , fresh from a landslide election win , addressed world leaders at the United Nations summit in New York on Thursday . He said Security Council reform is a \" just cause \" for the international community . He stressed Japan 's record of pacifism since the end of World War II . A proposal by the so-called Group of Four nations - Brazil , India , Germany and Japan - calls for increasing the Security Council to 25 with six new permanent members . But the proposal is opposed by China and the United States and has failed to gain support among other council members . Europe 's debt crisis got worse Tuesday as a rating agency slashed the credit ratings for the Greek and Portuguese governments . Standard and Poor 's cut Greek long-term government bonds three levels to speculative or \" junk \" status because of the \" political , economic and budgetary challenges \" facing Athens . But African Union peacekeepers have been unable to stop militia attacks on civilians since then . The same agency downgraded Portugal 's sovereign debt by two notches . S & P said it has growing concerns about the ability of the Greek and Portuguese governments to repay debts . The move followed weeks of talks among European nations and the International Monetary Fund about an aid package worth as much as $ 60 billion for Greece . The lower rating means lenders will demand higher interest rates , raising borrowing costs at a time when Greece and Portugal are already struggling with financial issues . The downgrades prompted Greek and Portuguese stocks to fall sharply in Tuesday 's trading . China says it is \" sincere \" about establishing diplomatic relations with the Vatican , but has repeated a long-standing requirement that the Holy See acknowledge Taiwan as part of China . A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman , Kong Quan , Tuesday expressed hope that under the new pope , the Vatican will create favorable conditions for establishing relations . But he said the Vatican must recognize Taiwan as an \" inseparable part of China . \" Pope Benedict last week invited countries without diplomatic relations with the Vatican to establish ties soon . He did not name the countries , but China , Saudi Arabia and Vietnam are among the nations that do not have diplomatic ties with the Vatican . Prosecutors in Ukraine say they want to question former President Leonid Kuchma about the death of an investigative reporter five years ago . China broke relations with the Vatican after the communists took power more than 50 years ago . The Vatican , meanwhile , has maintained full diplomatic relations with Taiwan .

Private First Class Lynndie England is charged with maltreatment , conspiracy to maltreat detainees , and committing an indecent act . She faces up to 11 years in prison . In May , Private England 's case ended in a mistrial when the presiding judge threw out her guilty plea . The judge said testimony from a key witness indicated that Private England did not know her actions were a crime when she committed them . To plead guilty under U.S. military law , a defendant must know they were committing a crime . Photos of Private England mistreating Iraqi detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison sparked international outrage last year . A U.N. spokeswoman says the United Nations Human Rights Council will hold a special meeting later this week to examine Israel 's military offensive in Lebanon .

Israel 's ambassador rejected the July resolution and accused the council of bias against the Jewish state . Russia and France are calling on Iran to stop all uranium enrichment . The two countries issued their statement Tuesday during a visit to Moscow by French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin . Iran resumed small-scale uranium enrichment Monday -- an initial step in the process of producing fuel for nuclear reactors or atomic weapons . Iran had threatened to resume enrichment after the International Atomic Energy Agency referred it this month to the U.N. Security Council for possible sanctions . China , another permanent member of the U.N. Security Council , called Tuesday for continued diplomatic efforts to ease growing tensions over Iran 's nuclear program . U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan , who met with President Bush in Washington Monday , said he hopes there will be no steps to escalate the situation .

In a statement , the lawmakers said Mr. Yushchenko 's election last year is inspiring the spread of democracy throughout the world . Mr. Yushchenko meets President Bush at the White House Monday . Last year 's presidential election in Ukraine was a bitter contest marred by controversy . Mr. Yushchenko defeated his rival Viktor Yanukovych in a repeat election held after Ukraine 's Supreme Court threw out the results of a previous vote because of widespread fraud . U.S. military officials in Iraq say American and Iraqi forces have launched operations against insurgents in the northern city of Mosul . Spokeswoman Captain Angela Bowman told reporters in Iraq 's third largest city that forces are moving in Tuesday to secure police stations hit hard by insurgents in recent days .

The police raid came after U.S. and Kuwaiti authorities issued statements warning of the likelihood of more attacks against Western targets in the emirate . It was the third such clash in Kuwait this month . Two security officers and two gunmen were killed in the earlier violence . Pakistan and India have begun two days of talks in Islamabad on a proposed multi-billion dollar pipeline that would carry gas from Iran into India through Pakistan . It is the first meeting between India 's Oil Minister Mani Shankar Aiyar and his Pakistani counterpart , Amanullah Khan Jadoon , on the 2,700 kilometer project . Pakistan 's foreign ministry spokesman said recently the bilateral talks will be followed later this year by three-way discussions involving Iranian officials . Washington opposes the project over concerns about Iran 's nuclear program . In remarks to reporters , Qureia said the two sides agreed during recent meetings to begin writing out their positions on all issues discussed during peace negotiations . The former president has denied any involvement in Mr. Gongadze 's death . But Mr. Aiyar dismissed U.S. opposition , saying India will not be pressured by any country . Burma has released thousands of prisoners to mark the 57th anniversary of the country 's independence from Britain . A government-run newspaper , New Light of Myanmar , says 5,588 prisoners have been freed on humanitarian grounds to coincide with the holiday . Monday 's gesture differs from three previous mass releases , which were conducted because of what the junta described as irregularities in arrests by the now dismantled National Intelligence bureau . The bureau 's former chief , former prime minister Khin Nyunt , has been placed under house arrest on accusations of corruption . The government has released nearly 20,000 prisoners since early November . Although about 50 dissidents were freed in prior releases , there was no indication that any political prisoners were let go this time . Human Rights Watch says a climate of fear threatens the Democratic Republic of Congo 's first elections in 40 years . The New York-based rights group says there was an increase in the number of attacks and detentions of journalists , human rights defenders and members of the political opposition in April and May . Human Rights Watch said Congolese authorities have failed to provide protection to the groups , and charged that security forces were involved in some of the attacks . Friday , his former interior minister , Yuri Kravchenko , apparently committed suicide hours before he was to be questioned in the case . The rights group urged a U.N. Security Council delegation set to visit the DRC Sunday to speak out against the intimidation . It said the elections , set for July 30 , can not be free and fair if the press and civil society are too afraid to speak out or engage in legitimate political debate . The DRC has been struggling to recover from a five-year civil war that left an estimated four million people dead . A moderate earthquake has sent people running away from the coastline of Indonesia 's Sulawesi island , less than a week after a powerful quake off Java island generated a tsunami that killed nearly 700 people . The latest quake , of 6.1 magnitude , struck deep under the waters of Tomini Bay off northern Sulawesi 's Gorontalo province Sunday . Fears of a tsunami proved unfounded , however , and there are no reports of damage or injuries . Japanese and U.S. monitoring agencies in the Pacific Ocean did not issue a tsunami warning after the quake . A powerful earthquake off the coast of Java last Monday generated a crushing wave that barreled through homes , restaurants and hotels in the Pangandaran area . Indonesian officials say the death toll from that tsunami has climbed to at least 668 . Thousands of prisoners in Kenya reportedly volunteered to skip lunch on New Year 's day so that the food could be sent to those suffering from famine . U.S. first lady Laura Bush has visited a center for missing children and praised the work of those trying to reunite the families separated by Hurricane Katrina . They skipped the meal after President Mwai Kibaki declared Kenya 's famine a national disaster and asked for more than $ 150 million in relief aid . Inadequate rainfall during Kenya 's rainy season has caused crop failure and the depletion of livestock herds .

Mrs. Bush greeted volunteers at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children outside Washington Friday . The Free Burma Rangers says Burmese forces have displaced thousands of villagers in Karen state , burning their homes and rice crops . The group says nearly 5000 villagers are hiding in jungle and mountain areas of Burma . The U.S. Campaign for Burma last week reported similar attacks . The human right group said the attacks were aimed at bringing eastern Burma , which has historically been under control of Burma 's ethnic minorities , under the control of the country 's military government . Rights groups say more than 5,00,000 villagers are believed to have been forced from their homes in eastern Burma over the past decade . Spanish authorities say firefighters are making progress against wildfires that have scorched large parts of the Canary Islands . Officials said Wednesday the fires on the main islands of Tenerife and Gran Canaria had \" stabilized \" as winds eased and temperatures moderated . Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero inspected the damage and promised special government aid . Authorities say a quarter of the forests on both islands have been incinerated , along with habitats of rare plants and animals . The blazes have not reached coastal resorts popular with European tourists . The center in Alexandria , Virginia says more than 2,000 children are still reported missing from the hurricane or are looking for their parents or other caregivers . Environmentalists call the fires a catastrophe . About 9,000 people were in emergency shelters on Tenerife Wednesday , while most of the 5,000 displaced people on Gran Canaria have begun returning home . Tenerife authorities say they suspect arsonists started the wildfire on the island . Police on Gran Canaria are holding a forest worker who confessed to starting a fire there last Friday . A group of prominent political religious and business figures , led by former Czech President Vaclav Havel , has criticized Russia 's handling of a separatist rebellion in Chechnya . A letter by the group Wednesday accuses Russian President Vladimir Putin of using the war in Chechnya to take away people 's freedoms and re-establish an autocracy . In addition to Havel , the authors of the letter include former Irish President Mary Robinson , retired South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu , and billionaire George Soros . The letter appeared in a Prague newspaper , the Mlada Fronta Dnes , Wednesday as the Russian leader was due to begin a visit to the Czech capital . Russian troops battled separatist rebels in Chechnya for several years in the 1990s , but the fighting has subsided in recent years with pro-Russian forces controlling much of the republic . Cuban President Raul Castro says the ruling Communist Party will hold a congress in April , the first party congress to be held in Cuba since 1997 . Photographs and information of the missing , including adults , are posted on the center 's website . Mr. Castro said the island 's leaders will meet to chart a new economic future for the country . He made the announcement after meeting Monday with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez . There has been intense speculation that Fidel Castro 's future might be discussed at the next Communist Party congress , but Raul Castro did not mention his brother Monday . Fidel Castro , 84 , stepped down as president of Cuba in 2006 , but remains head of the Communist Party . Vatican officials say Pope John Paul II is getting nutrition through a nasal tube to boost his calorie intake and help what they call his \" slow and progressive \" recovery from throat surgery . A Vatican spokesman said the pontiff spends many hours in an armchair , celebrates Mass and works in contact with his aides in directly following church activities . He issued the statement shortly after the 84-year-old pontiff appeared at his window overlooking Saint Peter 's Square Wednesday , to bless the faithful . The crowd greeted the pope with cheers and applause when he raised his hand to bless them . But he was unable to speak when an aide put a microphone in front of him . The Vatican statement was the first official medical report on the pope since March 10 , three days before he was discharged from a hospital following a tracheotomy . Some children are only listed by their first name , as their full identification is still unknown , nearly three weeks after the storm hit . A group of Palestinian gunmen have briefly seized Bethelehem city hall in the West Bank , apparently demanding financial assistance from the Palestinian Authority . About 20 gunmen appeared on the roof of the city hall Tuesday , ordered all workers out and threatened to open fire . Palestinian police sealed off the streets leading to the building on Manger Square , near the Church of the Nativity . Officials say the gunmen were linked to the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades militant faction of the ruling Fatah movement of Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas . They were demanding money for about 300 members . The gunmen left the building after about an hour , following talks with the governor of Bethlehem . It was not immediately clear how the standoff was resolved . The incident is another sign of growing turmoil within the Palestinian territories ahead of a January parliamentary election . Pakistani officials say five militants , including suicide bombers , have been killed while trying to enter a military training area in the country 's northwest . Authorities say security forces opened fire on the attackers Tuesday as they tried to infiltrate the training center in the town of Mardan , near the Afghan border . The American Red Cross also has a registry of the missing . Officials say three suicide bombers detonated their explosives during the gunbattle , while two other militants were killed by troops . Four soldiers were wounded in the attack . There was no immediate claim of responsibility , but Taliban militants have carried out attacks in the area in the past . Russian President Vladimir Putin says the Kremlin 's opposition to independence for Kosovo is based on international law and a desire for regional stability . Mr. Putin said during talks with Serbian President Boris Tadic Sunday that Russia 's position is not based on what he calls ethnic or historical considerations . Mr. Tadic repeated Serbia 's opposition to an independent Kosovo , but said he is willing to compromise . Kosovo is an ethnic Albanian majority province of Serbia . The United Nations Security Council is considering a draft resolution that backs a U.N. envoy 's plan for supervised independence for the region .

Tuesday , China canceled a trip to Beijing by Japan 's foreign minister , saying the visit was not timely given the current situation . The Yasukuni shrine honors 2.5 million Japanese war dead , including convicted war criminals . Critics say Yasukuni represents Japan 's past military aggression , but Mr. Koizumi says his visits are to pray for peace . President Bush says sanctions are a \" real possibility \" against Iran for its controversial nuclear program . Interviewed Friday on the CBS television network , Mr. Bush said a free world can not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon . Mr. Bush said he is open to all possible options for dealing with Iran , including military intervention . But he said that would be the last option . Mr. Carter told an audience in Atlanta Tuesday that closing the camp and several other secret detention centers around the globe would show that the United States is committed to defending human rights . In Tehran , the chief of Iran 's Revolutionary Guards , General Yahya Rahim Safavi , said Saturday his country would use ballistic missiles to defend itself if attacked . On Friday , the U.S. Senate voted unanimously to condemn Iran 's nuclear program , and to support referring Tehran to the United Nations Security Council for allegedly violating the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . The International Atomic Energy Agency meets February 2 in Vienna to discuss the Iran nuclear standoff . A brief gunbattle between rival Fatah factions erupted outside the Gaza headquarters of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas Wednesday , as the ruling party prepared to register its list of candidates for January 's parlimentary elections . Witnesses say at least three people were wounded . The clash occurred after Fatah gunmen stormed the building demanding that the party respect the results of recent primary elections . Mr. Abbas has decided to appoint candidates after canceling the results of the primaries in Gaza and some other areas where balloting was marred by violence and fraud . Some hard-liners fear they will not be properly represented in the Fatah list . On Tuesday , a flare-up of election-related violence in Gaza forced Palestinian election officials to close their offices in the there and in the West Bank . The offices are to open later today . He did not elaborate on why negotiators had come to the decision . Earlier this week , a leading Democrat in the Senate called on President Bush to shut down the Guantanamo camp and launch a massive probe into alleged abuses there . Mr. Abbas has been struggling to contain internal unrest since Israel pulled out of Gaza in September . U.S. troops and Iraqi security forces have detained 49 suspected insurgents north of Baghdad , as operations continue to secure the country ahead of January 's election . The U.S. military says the pre-dawn raid Friday was in the town of Duluiyah , in the insurgent-plagued Sunni Triangle north and west of Baghdad . Meanwhile , in Baghdad , firefighters extinguished a blaze at the city 's main oil refinery , which was attacked by saboteurs late Thursday . Also Friday , near Fallujah , the body of an Iraqi National Guardsman was found with a note warning others against working with U.S.-led forces . Iraq 's security forces have been the main target of insurgent violence . And South Korea 's parliament overwhelmingly approved keeping its 3,600 troops in northern Iraq for another year . Pope Benedict has met with the parents of the four-year-old British girl who disappeared from a tourist resort in Portugal in early May . The pope Wednesday spoke to Gerry and Kate McCann following his weekly audience in St. Peter 's Square . The pontiff blessed a photograph of their daughter , Madeleine , who disappeared when the parents left her and two siblings in a resort hotel while they went to dinner . A report by the human rights group Amnesty International criticizes the U.S. military for holding terrorist suspects without charge and for other abuses . Kate McCann said the pope told her he would continue to pray for Madeleine 's safe return . The couple are devout Catholics , but Gerry McCann said he had conflicting emotions about meeting the pope because of the circumstances . The McCann 's are also planning to travel to Spain and Germany in their continued campaign to publicize their daughter 's disappearance . A public outcry in Britain and Portugal at the apparent abduction of young Madeleine has prompted politicians and celebrities to offer their support . A leading human rights group is criticizing what it calls the refusal by the United States and other western countries to intervene in Sudan 's troubled Darfur region . In its annual report , Human Rights Watch says western countries are wrong to leave peacekeeping duties in Darfur to the African Union , which the group calls a new institution with no peacekeeping experience . Last year , the African Union began sending peacekeepers to Darfur , where two years of fighting between rebels and government-backed militias have claimed an estimated 70,000 lives . On another issue , the HRW report says the abuse of prisoners by U.S. soldiers at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq weakened the worldwide system for protecting human rights . The report also condemns attacks on the rights of sexual minorities around the world . The Supreme Court of Pakistan has given the country 's election commission 30 days to register all eligible voters left out of draft electoral lists . Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has rejected the Amnesty report as \" absurd , \" and he says U.S. officials have no plans to close the camp at Guantanamo . The petition was filed by former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and her opposition Pakistan People 's Party . It contends that more than 20 million eligible voters had not been enrolled . At a hearing Friday , the election commission requested 140 days to prepare the revised lists . The two-member bench rejected the request , saying the time period was too long . The court instead granted the commission 30 days to make the necessary changes . The decision comes a day after Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf decided against declaring a state of emergency that could have delayed elections for a year . British diplomat John Sawers says Iran presented no major new proposals at Monday 's last-ditch talks aimed at resolving the standoff over Iran 's nuclear program . But Iran 's negotiator Javad Vaeedi described the session with Britain , Germany and France in Brussels as positive . The talks came before Monday 's meeting in London of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany on Iran 's nuclear program . President Bush , speaking at the White House , said there is an international consensus that Iran should not be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon . NATO says it is investigating allegations that seven members of a private security company were killed Saturday during an Afghan and coalition force operation . He says U.S. and other officials are working on how to go about achieving that goal . Later this week , the International Atomic Energy Agency holds an emergency session that could see Iran referred to the U.N. Security Council for possible sanctions . The U.S. unemployment rate fell unexpectedly in July , in one of the strongest signals yet that the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression may be ending . A report from the Labor Department Friday shows the unemployment rate dropped to 9.4 percent last month , compared to 9.5 percent in June . It is the first time the jobless rate has fallen since April 2008 . Employers cut 2,47,000 jobs in July . The number is much less than analysts had expected , but still an indication of a weak job market . In total , about 14.5 million people are unemployed in the United States . President Barack Obama has said the $ 787 billion economic stimulus plan he signed within months of taking office has stopped the recession from getting worse . Chinese President Hu Jintao is calling for closer economic and cultural relations with Taiwan to maintain peace in the region , and to curb what he calls the island 's \" secessionist activities . \" A coalition statement says the deadly shooting happened after its service members had \" peacefully detained \" a Haqqani facilitator in Paktiya province . China 's official Xinhua news agency says Mr. Hu made the comments Saturday in Beijing at a forum on China and Taiwan business ties . Xinhua says that during the forum , the Chinese leader met with the honorary chairman of Taiwan 's main opposition party , Lien Chan . About 500 participants are attending the two-day event . They are expected to discuss issues including direct flights from Taiwan to the mainland . Taiwan and China split in 1949 following a civil war . But Beijing still considers the island as part of its territory and has threatened to use force if necessary to reunite the two sides . The man who has been guiding the U.S. economy for the past 18 years , Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan , is set to retire at the end of January . The head of the U.S. central bank is highly regarded by economists , markets and political leaders . President Bush has given no indication who he is considering to replace Mr. Greenspan or when his decision will be announced . News reports speculate that the chairman of Mr. Bush 's Council of Economic Advisors , Ben Bernanke , is the leading candidate . NATO says after the joint force used a bullhorn to call for occupants of a vehicle to \" exit peacefully , \" a man got out of the vehicle with an AK-47 . He is a monetary economist and a former member of the key Fed committee that sets interest rates . Other candidates include academic economists with policy experience like Glenn Hubbard and Martin Feldstein . Venezuela says a bomb attack has killed Deputy Attorney General Danilo Anderson . Officials told VOA Friday the charred body has been positively identified as that of Mr. Anderson , who was killed around midnight Thursday as he drove through a suburb of Caracas . Mr. Anderson had been in charge of prosecuting several hundred politicians , businessmen and former military officers involved in a failed April 2002 coup that briefly ousted President Hugo Chavez . Officials say President Chavez has canceled his trip to Costa Rica Friday to attend the Ibero-American summit . They say he has also canceled a two-week tour of Spain , Iran , Libya and Russia that was to begin this weekend . The price of crude oil soared Tuesday , hitting a new record high above $ 119 a barrel in New York trading . The price of crude oil for future delivery went to $ 119.48 cents a barrel . Traders say a tight balance between demand and supply means oil prices jump when supplies seem threatened or demand rises . The alliance says the security force assessed the man \" to be hostile \" and shot him . Currently supply concerns are growing out of violence in Nigeria , reports that Russia will produce less oil this year , and a possible strike by Scottish refinery workers . The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries says it will boost its current 32-million-barrel-a-day output by a bit more than one quarter by the year 2020 . That will help meet growing demand in the long term but has little effect on oil prices right now . OPEC officials say there is sufficient oil on the market and blames rising prices on speculators and the falling U.S. dollar . Three people have been rescued after a tunnel allegedly used by Palestinian weapons smugglers collapsed . Israel says a joint Israeli army and Palestinian operation succeeded in reaching the men , several hours after the tunnel along the border between the Gaza Strip and Egypt fell in . The incident happened in the same area where Israeli soldiers shot and killed three Egyptian police officers Thursday . The Israeli army says a tank crew mistook the Egyptians for Palestinian militants and opened fire . Egypt has condemned the killings . The Israeli army has expressed its regret . NATO says several armed individuals then clashed with the force , resulting in seven deaths . Israeli officials also apologized and opened an investigation . European Union regulators have fined Microsoft Corporation $ 357 million for failing to share programming code with its rivals , as demanded by a 2004 antitrust ruling . The EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes says Microsoft is continuing its illegal conduct , and no company is above the law . The fine was assessed at a rate of nearly $ 2 million a day from December 16 through June 20 . EU officials say Microsoft 's daily fines will double ( to $ 3.8 million ) at the end of this month if the company 's violations continue . The European Union fined Microsoft $ 633 million in 2004 and ordered the company to give its rivals the technical information necessary for their programs to operate smoothly on computers using Microsoft 's Windows operating system . Microsoft has said it has 300 people working full time to comply with the EU 's orders , and that any additional fines would be unjustified . Icy rain and snow brought down a major power line in Moscow , shutting down the city 's main airport and snarling traffic on its busy streets . Officials said on Sunday that flights from the Domodedovo airport were suspended for almost 15 hours until the power was partially restored and some planes were allowed to take off . Flights from Moscow 's second airport , Sheremetyevo , were operating , but travelers experienced delays . NATO says it is assessing who the individuals were . Roughly 2,00,000 people were left without power as ice snapped power lines and slicked over the capital 's streets and encased cars . According to Russia 's state-owned news agency , Ria Novosti , some 6,000 passengers were stranded at Domodedovo , and taxis were charging more than $ 300 to take clients to the airport . Officials warned residents to stay home until conditions improved . The United Nations says in the past year more than one million people contracted HIV infections in South Asia , and the disease is spreading largely due to drug use and unsafe sex . In its annual report on the global AIDS epidemic , the world body says the spread of HIV is stabilizing in some of India 's states , but overall it is still rising . India already has an estimated 5.1 million HIV-positive people . According to the report , some 42 percent of female sex workers in India say they are able to guess if their clients are HIV positive because of their physical appearance . But the report says ignorance about the disease is serious elsewhere in South Asia . Citing Pakistan as an example , the report says one in every five female sex workers in the largest city of Karachi can not recognize a condom , and one-third never heard of AIDS . Israel has agreed to free 170 Palestinian prisoners . Brazilian security forces , backed by tanks and helicopters , have carried out an operation to recover stolen weapons from a slum in Rio de Janeiro . The release is part of a promise Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon made to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to secure the release this month of an Israeli jailed by Egypt on espionage charges . Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon called Sunday 's decision a goodwill gesture toward the Egyptian leader . The Palestinians are expected to be freed in the next week . The prisoners ' identities were not immediately known , but Israel has said it would not release those it said had \" blood on their hands . \" Palestinian officials have long demanded the release of thousands of prisoners held by Israel . They have also criticized previous prisoner releases as inadequate . The U.S. secretary of the interior said he will not change a Bush administration rule on protection of polar bears , despite pressure from environmentalists . Ken Salazar announced Friday that a special rule applying to polar bears , under the Endangered Species Act , can only restrict dangers to the bears that originate in the bears ' northern habitat . That rules out application of the rule to carbon emissions farther south , even though they can affect the Arctic climate where the bears live .

The Brotherhood says the government campaign is a direct reaction to the group 's rejection of constitutional amendments proposed by President Hosni Mubarak . Officials of the Brotherhood say the amendments are aimed at giving the ruling party more power and barring Muslim Brothers from politics . The Brotherhood won a fifth of the seats in Egypt 's parliament by running members as independents in the 2005 elections , making it the largest opposition group . The constitutional amendments proposed by Mr. Mubarak would reduce the role of judges in monitoring elections and ban religious groups from forming political parties .

Each right entitles the shareholder to buy $ 100 face amount of 13.5 % bonds due 1993 and warrants to buy 23.5 common shares at 30 cents a share . The rights , which expire Nov. 21 , can be exercised for $ 100 each . Iraqi Kurdish negotiators say they will resume talks Monday with the country 's dominant Shi'ite alliance to hammer out details of a coalition government . Integra , which owns and operates hotels , said that Hallwood Group Inc. has agreed to exercise any rights that are n't exercised by other shareholders . Hallwood , a Cleveland merchant bank , owns about 11 % of Integra . Having a small , open economy makes Macedonia vulnerable to economic developments in Europe and dependent on regional integration and progress toward EU membership for continued economic growth . At independence in September 1991 , Macedonia was the least developed of the Yugoslav republics , producing a mere 5 % of the total federal output of goods and services . The collapse of Yugoslavia ended transfer payments from the central government and eliminated advantages from inclusion in a de~facto free trade area . An absence of infrastructure , UN sanctions on the downsized Yugoslavia , and a Greek economic embargo over a dispute about the country 's constitutional name and flag hindered economic growth until 1996 . Since then , Macedonia has maintained macroeconomic stability with low inflation , but it has so far lagged the region in attracting foreign investment and creating jobs , despite making extensive fiscal and business sector reforms . Official unemployment remains high at 31.7 % , but may be overstated based on the existence of an extensive gray market , estimated to be more than 20 % of GDP , that is not captured by official statistics . In the wake of the global economic downturn , Macedonia has experienced decreased foreign direct investment , lowered credit , and a large trade deficit . However , as a result of conservative fiscal policies and a sound financial system , in 2010 the country received slightly improved credit ratings . He told reporters in the West Bank that there is still room for progress in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations . One of the negotiators , Fuad Masoum , says there are further , important issues that need to be resolved before a government is formed . Macroeconomic stability also was maintained by a prudent monetary policy , which kept the domestic currency at the pegged level against the euro , while interest rates were falling . As a result , GDP growth was modest , but positive , in 2010 . In late 1999 , about 70 % of the economic infrastructure of Timor-Leste was laid waste by Indonesian troops and anti-independence militias . Three hundred thousand people fled westward . Over the next three years a massive international program , manned by 5,000 peacekeepers ( 8,000 at peak ) and 1,300 police officers , led to substantial reconstruction in both urban and rural areas . By the end of 2005 , refugees had returned or had settled in Indonesia . The country continues to face great challenges in rebuilding its infrastructure , strengthening the civil administration , and generating jobs for young people entering the work force . The development of oil and gas resources in offshore waters has greatly supplemented government revenues . This technology-intensive industry , however , has done little to create jobs for the unemployed because there are no production facilities in Timor-Leste . Gas is piped to Australia . Negotiators have been hoping to agree on a government before Iraq 's National Assembly convenes for the first time on Wednesday . In June 2005 , the National Parliament unanimously approved the creation of a Petroleum Fund to serve as a repository for all petroleum revenues and to preserve the value of Timor-Leste 's petroleum wealth for future generations . The Fund held assets of US $ 6.6 billion as of October 2010 . The economy continues to recover strongly from the mid-2006 outbreak of violence and civil unrest , which disrupted both private and public sector economic activity . The government in 2008 resettled tens of thousands of an estimated 1,00,000 internally displaced persons ( IDPs ) ; most IDPs returned home by early 2009 . Government spending increased markedly in 2009 and 2010 , primarily on basic infrastructure , including electricity and roads . Limited experience in procurement and infrastructure building has hampered these projects . The underlying economic policy challenge the country faces remains how best to use oil-and-gas wealth to lift the non-oil economy onto a higher growth path and to reduce poverty . Finland was a province and then a grand duchy under Sweden from the 12th to the 19th centuries , and an autonomous grand duchy of Russia after 1809 . It won its complete independence in 1917 . During World War II , it was able to successfully defend its freedom and resist invasions by the Soviet Union - albeit with some loss of territory . Meanwhile , a roadside bomb south of Baghdad killed two American security contractors Sunday . In the subsequent half century , the Finns made a remarkable transformation from a farm / forest economy to a diversified modern industrial economy ; per capita income is now among the highest in Western Europe . A member of the European Union since 1995 , Finland was the only Nordic state to join the euro system at its initiation in January 1999 . In the 21st century , the key features of Finland 's modern welfare state are a high standard of education , equality promotion , and national social security system - currently challenged by an aging population and the fluctuations of an export-driven economy . Although 115 species of fish have been identified in the territorial waters of Clipperton Island , the only economic activity is tuna fishing . A RAVEN saw a Swan and desired to secure for himself the same beautiful plumage . Supposing that the Swan 's splendid white color arose from his washing in the water in which he swam , the Raven left the altars in the neighborhood where he picked up his living , and took up residence in the lakes and pools . But cleansing his feathers as often as he would , he could not change their color , while through want of food he perished . Change of habit can not alter Nature . A BOY was stung by a Nettle . He ran home and told his Mother , saying , \" Although it hurts me very much , I only touched it gently . \" To the north , in Mosul , witnesses say three Iraqi civilians were killed when a U.S. helicopter fired on insurgents . \" That was just why it stung you , \" said his Mother . \" The next time you touch a Nettle , grasp it boldly , and it will be soft as silk to your hand , and not in the least hurt you . \" Whatever you do , do with all your might .

One day she went down to the Bank of the Nile and drew out a little prophet . Also Sunday , a previously-unknown group claimed responsibility for last week 's bomb attack on a Shi'ite funeral that killed 50 people . Helium was up . Feathers were down . Paper was stationary . Knives were up sharply . Pencils lost a few points . Hiking equipment was trailing . Elevators rose , while escalators continued a slow decline . Light switches were off . Mining equipment hit rock bottom . Diapers remained unchanged . It says the attack was to demonstrate opposition to Shi'ites who are set to take control of Iraq 's new government . Shipping lines stayed at an even keel . Balloon prices were inflated . And batteries exploded in an attempt to recharge the market . A new public opinion poll indicates that Americans ' support for the war in Iraq is at its lowest ever - and that in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina , most Americans are concerned Iraq is draining money and resources needed at home . In a New York Times / CBS poll released Saturday , a record low number of those surveyed - only 44 percent - said the United States made the right decision in going to war in Iraq . Fifty-two percent wanted troops to be withdrawn as soon as possible , even if it means leaving the country unstable . Ninety percent said they would oppose cutting spending on domestic programs to continue funding the war . The nationwide poll of more than 1,000 adults was conducted September 9 through 13 . The United Nations food agency says a lack of funds has left three million Ethiopians who rely on food aid in danger of malnutrition . The World Food Program ( WFP ) appealed for $ 33 million Tuesday so that it can continue providing food in Ethiopia for the next two and a half months . A prominent U.S. newspaper says Washington wants to expand a secret Central Intelligence Agency operation in Pakistan designed to eliminate Islamic militants ' havens near the Afghan border . It says it has received only slightly more than half of the $ 212 million it needs this year for food aid in Ethiopia . The agency says it has less than 20 percent of what it needs for non-food items such as health , water and sanitation facilities . The WFP says malnutrition rates are on the rise in Ethiopia , with the situation especially bad in the eastern Somali region . There , the WFP says nearly five percent of children are severely malnourished . U.S. military officials say elements of the Russian Air Force will join U.S. and Canadian air units in the first-ever joint air defense exercises between the former Cold War foes . A statement from the North American Aerospace Defense Command , NORAD , says the maneuvers - set to begin August 8 - will include training to detect and combat terrorist attacks on commercial airliners . The exercises , code-named Vigilant Eagle , will be coordinated from a U.S. military command center at Elmendorf air base in Alaska and Russian facilities near the Far Eastern city of Khabarovsk . Russian Air Force spokesman , Lieutenant Colonel Vladimir Drik , described the exercises as part of a working plan to improve cooperation between Russian and U.S. forces . A NORAD statement said the maneuvers will require both the Russian and NORAD bases to launch or divert fighter planes to investigate and shadow commercial aircraft . A U.S. general says Iraqi investigators have broken up a ring of police officers who were kidnapping people , extorting ransoms and sometimes killing their victims . The Wall Street Journal reported late Friday the U.S. has asked Pakistan in recent weeks to allow more CIA officers and special operations military trainers into the country to participate in Washington 's efforts step up pressure on militants . In an interview with the USA Today newspaper , Major General Joseph Peterson said the unit is alleged to have operated in northern Baghdad , under the command of an Iraqi police general . General Peterson said the police general , who was not identified , was arrested and then released last month . He is said to remain under investigation . He said 17 others linked to the alleged ring remain in custody . Allegations of Iraqi police death squads operating in Iraq 's Shi'ite-dominated security forces have circulated widely in recent weeks . Hundreds of bodies - many of them showing signs of torture - have turned up in and around the capital since the February 22 bombing of a major Shi'ite shrine near Baghdad . At least 35,000 people have rallied in Pakistan 's largest city , Karachi , to protest controversial cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad . Shouting anti-American and anti-European slogans , the demonstrators marched through the city to denounce the cartoons , first published in Denmark last September . A coalition of radical Islamic groups which opposes President Pervez Musharraf 's support for the U.S.-led war on terror organized Sunday 's rally . Hundreds of riot police closely watched the gathering but no violence was reported . The report says Islamabad has refused the requests for additional personnel because it remains \" extremely wary \" of a larger U.S. ground presence in Pakistan . Some protests in Pakistan have turned deadly and at least five people died in rioting last month . Iraqi officials say former dictator Saddam Hussein will go on trial in the second half of October , so as not to affect the outcome of a national referendum on the constitution to be held October 15 . No official announcement has come from the Iraqi Special Tribunal in charge of the trials , but officials close to the case said Friday that Saddam Hussein will be tried for the 1982 killing of dozens of residents of the town of Dujail . The killings were allegedly in retaliation for a failed assassination attempt against him there . Later , Saddam Hussein is expected to be tried for other alleged crimes , including the 1988 gassing of Kurds in Halabja and the 1991 suppression of a Shi'ite uprising in southern Iraq . A U.S. official says the United States is willing to give Iran more time to consider a key uranium enrichment deal that will yield fuel for an Iranian nuclear research reactor . Washington 's envoy to the International Atomic Energy Agency , Glyn Davies , told reporters in Vienna Monday that , in his words , \" we want to give Iran some space . \" Davies also noted the negotiations have gone beyond the scheduled time frame . Iran has not officially responded to a U.N.-backed uranium-enrichment proposal that was drafted three weeks ago in Vienna . But leading Iranian parliamentarian Alaeddin Boroujerdi Saturday indicated Tehran will reject the plan to send any of its 1,200 kilograms of enriched uranium abroad for further enrichment . The newspaper reports the number of CIA personnel in Pakistan is \" highly classified , \" but says it \" has grown substantially \" in recent years . IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei had asked for the parties involved with the proposal ( Iran , the United States , Russia and France ) to respond by October 23 . The U.S. Senate has been debating a military funding bill that would require President Bush to begin withdrawing troops from Iraq in October . The measure is expected to pass Thursday in the Democratic-controlled Senate . The legislation sets a non-binding goal of withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq by April of next year . It also sets benchmarks for Iraq 's government to show progress in securing the country . The Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives approved a similar measure Wednesday . White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said President Bush will veto the legislation \" very soon \" after it arrives on his desk . The House measure lacked the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto , and the Senate measure is not expected to have enough votes to override a veto , either . The Senate bill includes some $ 95 billion to fund military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan through the end of September . Amnesty International says Taleban insurgents are deliberately targeting civilians in Afghanistan to instill fear and exert control over the population . The Israeli military says Major General Udi Adam - the head of the army 's Northern Command - has announced his resignation . The Wall Street Journal says Washington wants Islamabad to take \" more aggressive action \" against groups allied with al-Qaida . The London-based rights group said Thursday that civilians are increasingly facing suicide attacks , abductions and beheadings . The organization said Taleban militants have a deliberate policy of killing teachers , abducting aid workers and burning school buildings . It said targets also include women 's rights activists , clerics , government and health workers and teachers . Amnesty said at least 756 civilians were killed in 2006 , mostly from roadside bombs and suicide attacks . On Wednesday , a U.S. commander in eastern Afghanistan said an expected Taleban offensive has not materialized , partly because of increased operations by U.S. and NATO forces . Brigadier General Joseph Votel says there are clashes every day , but they are mostly small scale . U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson is warning against irresponsible borrowing or lending to countries that have recently received debt relief . Speaking in Singapore Monday to the World Bank 's policy-setting committee , Paulson said the organization should develop an approach that prevents a reemergence of debt distress . He did not single out any country , but stressed that creditors are still providing large loans to countries that have recently received debt relief . China , in particular , has come under fire for providing loans to many countries in Africa that have only recently had large debts forgiven .

A top U.S. lawmaker says he has urged North Korea to return to the six-party talks over its nuclear weapons program . Congressman Tom Lantos - a Democrat from the western U.S. state of California - spoke in Beijing Tuesday after three days of talks with high-ranking North Korean officials including the vice president of the Presidium of the Supreme People 's Assembly , Yang Hyong-sop , and Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun . Authorities say the accident occurred Saturday , near the town of Veligonda in southern Andhra Pradesh state . Mr. Lantos says the officials told him they support a resumption of the talks , but want to see the shape of President Bush 's second administration before making any commitments . However , Mr. Lantos says there is no reason for Pyongyang to expect a significant change in U.S. policy towards the Korean peninsula . North Korea has participated in three rounds of multi-party talks on its nuclear ambitions , but boycotted a fourth round scheduled for September because of what it called Washington 's hostile policy . Iraqi police say a car bomb has killed at least five people and wounded 17 others in Baghdad , shattering a lull in insurgent attacks in the Iraqi capital . Iraqi and U.S. forces launched a massive sweep for militants in Baghdad two weeks ago . About 1,000 suspects have been arrested and the number of attacks has dropped .

Authorities believe the victims were kidnapped Iraqi soldiers . The U.S. economy shrank at a 5.7 percent annual pace in the first three months of this year . Friday 's report from the Commerce Department said the decline was a bit less ( 0.4 percent ) than estimated earlier , and better than the prior quarter . Many government economic experts and private economists say the worst of the recession may have passed , and they predict slow economic growth will resume later this year . Other economic reports Friday showed U.S. business activity declining faster in a key region , while consumers grew less pessimistic . Consumer sentiment hit its highest level since September , but remained at a relatively low level . Economists track consumer confidence for clues about the consumer demand that drives most U.S. economic activity . A separate report from an industry group said the pace of business activity in the U.S. Midwest fell even faster in May than in the previous month . Riot police have clashed with thousands of demonstrators in Indian Kashmir 's summer capital , Srinagar .

Sirens wailed across Israel Tuesday in remembrance of victims of the Holocaust , with citizens briefly standing in silence and motorists stopping their cars at the sides of major highways . Commemorations honoring the estimated six million Jews killed by the Nazis during World War II were held at Yad Vashem holocaust memorial in Jerusalem . Thousands of people also marched in silence in southern Poland at the site of the Auschwitz death camp . Rescuers used ropes to help them wade through the water to reach the train carriages and then drag bodies onto higher land . Former Israeli Prime Minister and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shimon Peres joined the commemoration . A shofar , or ram 's horn sounded as about 8,000 people began the three-kilometer trek to the gas chambers at Birkenau , where the Nazis killed at least 1.1 million Jews , Roma ( Gypsies ) and others . The first such march was held 20 years ago and now takes place as an annual memorial to the victims of Nazi Germany 's extermination campaign .

Malawai 's Vice President Cassim Chilumpha has been arrested on charges of plotting to overthrow the government . The Minister of Justice says the vice president was plotting with associates to hire an assassin to kill Malawi 's President Bingu wa Mutharika . He told local media he has taped conversations of Chilumpha 's meetings with the would-be assassin . A laboratory in Hong Kong has confirmed it was the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu that killed two Indonesian children from the same family this month . In February , Mr. Mutharika tried to fire the vice president for failing to attend cabinet meetings , among other charges . Malawi 's high court reinstated Chilumpha last month . Mr. Mutharika and Chilumpha were running mates in the 2004 elections , but have been feuding since the president quit the United Political Party and created his own political party .

China is objecting to a decision by Internet search engine Google to change maps referring to Taiwan as a province of China . China 's state media report that officials are worried the decision may mislead people and give the impression of an independent Taiwan . A Google spokesman told Xinhua the change was part of a regular update of all the site 's maps , rather than a deliberate effort to update the Taiwan page . Earlier this month , Taiwan asked Google to stop listing it as a Chinese province on its maps . An Indonesian Health Ministry official said Saturday the deaths in West Java province raise the country 's toll from bird flu to 14 confirmed cases . Now Google maps simply call the island Taiwan . Taiwan calls itself the Republic of China . China views Taiwan as a breakaway province . The two split in a civil war that ended in 1949 .

The International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) says a staff member who was kidnapped in Darfur three days ago is doing well and is in good spirits . The kidnappers allowed Red Cross officials to speak with Gauthier Lefevre by telephone for the first time on Sunday . Two Germans and four Nigerian oil workers were kidnapped by armed militants during a raid on a boat in Nigeria 's southern oil-rich Delta region . A military statement Wednesday , said General Adam has asked to leave his post \" as soon as possible , \" and the chief of staff has accepted the request to begin the process of his replacement . His 13-year-old sister died the previous week , and a third sibling is suffering symptoms of the virus . Lefevre , a French national , was traveling in one of two clearly marked Red Cross vehicles when he was abducted Thursday near the town of Al Geneina in West Darfur . The Red Cross says Lefevre was taken captive after he and another staffer had just completed a trip to help local communities upgrade their water systems . The captors have not made any ransom demands . Foreign aid groups have faced increased hostility in Darfur since the International Criminal Court indicted Sudan 's President Omar al-Bashir in March for alleged war crimes . The presidents of Benin and Nigeria have helped launch a program to vaccinate 40 million children in the region against polio . Benin 's President Mathieu Kerekou and his Nigerian counterpart Olusegun Obasanjo met on their shared border Sunday to drop vaccine into babies ' mouths to start the campaign . The World Health Organization is backing the effort aimed at reversing a surge in polio cases which started in Nigeria . In late 2003 , Islamic leaders in northwestern Nigeria suspended immunizations , claiming the WHO had supplied a vaccine that would cause sterility . Health officials denied the claim . The WHO said the ban caused the number of polio cases in West Africa to double last year . Elsewhere , Ukraine has confirmed a new outbreak of bird flu among birds in the southern Crimea Peninsula . Nigerian leaders last year agreed to resume anti-polio efforts , using a different vaccine . The news that the 17-year-old unmarried daughter of Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin is pregnant has brought the issues of teen sex and sex education into the media spotlight .

As Brian Padden reports , the issues of sexual activity by teens and how information about sex is conveyed to them in school are highly controversial . The U.S. business newspaper The Wall Street Journal says a United Nations study of problems with the U.N. oil-for-food program in Iraq will criticize Secretary-General Kofi Annan for a series of management lapses , among them conflicts of interest involving Mr. Annan 's son , Kojo . An investigative panel headed by former U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker is expected to criticize Mr. Annan for failing to take action to correct flaws in the U.N. bureaucracy that allowed problems to develop in the $ 40 billion oil-for-food program . The Wall Street Journal says the U.N. report will find that Mr. Annan held at least four meetings with Cotecna , a Swiss company that held lucrative United Nations contracts and also employed Mr. Annan 's son , Kojo . The new report , the second of three to be issued by the Volcker commission this year , is due to be made public on Tuesday . A senior Palestinian security official says there is progress in efforts to free two Western journalists abducted in Gaza nearly two weeks ago . Interior Minister Said Siyam , of the militant Islamic group Hamas , said Friday officials are attempting to secure the release of the men . Ukrainian officials say they do not yet know if the birds had the H5N1 strain . He did not elaborate . His statement was the first upbeat assessment by Palestinian officials since gunmen seized Fox correspondent , American Steve Centanni , and cameraman Olaf Wiig of New Zealand on August 14 . On Thursday , Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh condemned the kidnapping and called for the release of the men . A group calling itself the Holy Jihad Brigades said it is holding the two journalists . It demanded that the U.S. release Muslim prisoners it is holding by Saturday . The commander of Russia 's strategic missile force says Russia is capable of targeting U.S. missile defense sites if they are built in the Czech Republic and Poland . General Nikolai Solovtsov warned Monday that Russia has the ability to resume building intermediate and short-range missiles if the Kremlin drops out of an arms treaty with the United States . A NATO spokesman Monday described the general 's comments as \" extreme language \" that is uncalled for and out of date . The Polish and Czech prime ministers , Jaroslaw Kaczynski and Mirek Topolanek , said Monday they would likely accept Washington 's proposal to build U.S. missile defense sites . Washington says the sites would defend against missile launches from Iran or North Korea . The World Health Organization has confirmed more than 80 deaths from bird flu in East Asia and Turkey since 2003 . Russian President Vladimir Putin has called the presence of a missile defense system so close to Russia 's border a threat to its security . Thousands of Syrians took to the streets of Damascus Monday to protest a U.N. probe they said unfairly blames the government for the killing of Lebanese former Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri . Damascus says the investigation was politically motivated and denies any involvement in the assassination . The U.N. report , issued last week , implicated Lebanese and Syrian officials in the killing . It said Syria 's cooperation in the probe was limited . In an interview with British radio on Sunday , U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw called for international pressure against Syria . Syria 's official news agency reported President Bashar al-Assad sent a message to members of the U.N. Security Council , which is expected to consider sanctions over the killing . Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has called for an investigation into U.S.-based CNN , saying the news network was seeking his assassination after its Spanish-language channel ran an image of him next to a caption that read , \" Who killed him ? \" CNN issued an apology over Tuesday 's video mix-up , saying the caption had been meant for a story about Washington Redskins football star Sean Taylor , who died Tuesday in Florida of a gunshot wound . But President Chavez said he doubted the caption was broadcast next to his image by mistake and called on his attorney general to probe the incident . An outbreak of cholera in West Africa has killed at least 177 people and sickened more than 9,000 in Guinea-Bissau within the past month .

Mr. Kosachyov urged Russian agencies to respond to the report to prevent what he called a spiraling of speculation . A United Nations war crimes court has sentenced a former Rwandan mayor to 15 years in prison for his role in the 1994 genocide . The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda accepted a plea bargain in which Paul Bisengimina pled guilty to two counts of murder and extermination . In exchange , the prosecution dropped eight other charges . The 58-year-old Bisengimina was mayor of Gikoro in 1994 and was involved in the slaughter of minority Tutsis who had sought refuge at a church . Presiding Judge Arlete Ramaroson said Thursday that Bisengimina 's guilty plea could encourage others to come forward and confess their crimes .

Thousands of Peruvians took to the streets of the capital , Lima , Tuesday to demand the extradition of former President Alberto Fujimori from Chile . Reports from the scene say the protest was led by human rights groups and labor unions seeking to have the former president returned to Chile , where he faces charges of corruption and of authorizing death squads during his 10-year presidency . Mr. Fujimori fled to Japan and faxed his resignation letter to Peru in the midst of a corruption scandal in 2000 . He was arrested when he traveled to Chile last week . Separately , in the Gaza Strip , Hamas security forces say they found a bomb near the Palestinian parliament building . Meanwhile , the Santiago Court of Appeals Tuesday turned down a motion by a private citizen to free the former president . The citizen 's connection to the case was not clear . This means Mr. Fujimori will remain under arrest . The United Nations is sending a veteran Portuguese diplomat to war-torn Ivory Coast to help organize presidential elections in October . U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan Friday chose Antonio Monteiro for the job , a former Portuguese foreign minister and U.N. ambassador . He is tasked with ensuring the elections are open , free and fair . Last month , Ivory Coast 's warring parties renewed pledges to abide by an April peace deal brokered by South Africa , which includes holding elections on October 30 . Several previous deals failed to take hold because of political disagreements and delays by both the government and rebels to disarm . Ivory Coast has been split in two , with rebels in the north and the government in control of the south , since a failed coup attempt in 2002 . Burma has released two lawyers who were convicted of contempt of court last year and sentenced to four months in prison . Hamas blamed members of the rival Fatah movement for planting the device . Supreme court lawyers U Aung Thein and U Khin Maung Shein were released Friday after serving their full sentences . The two lawyers had represented student activists . Burma 's High Court sentenced them in November for what was described as a lack of respect for the court . The Asian Human Rights Commission welcomed their release and expressed hope they will be permitted to continue practicing their profession . The Hong-Kong-based group quoted U Aung Thein and U Khin Maung Shein as saying they had no chance to defend themselves . The two said their clients withdrew their powers of attorney because they lost faith in the judicial process . The Asian Human Rights Commission said Burma 's contempt-of-court law contains no guidance on how contempt is to be assessed and heard fairly . Iraqi negotiators are struggling to reach an agreement on a new constitution before a Monday deadline , as hundreds marched to press their demands for a new government . Officials said Saturday they were nearing agreement on a Shi'ite demand to enshrine Islam as the only source of legislation . Kurdish officials said they still oppose the move . Hamas seized control of Gaza in June after factional fighting with Fatah that killed more than 100 people . But negotiators say the United States may be prepared to drop its objections to having Islam as the sole basis of a new Iraqi government . Saturday 's talks also focused on granting self-determination to Iraqi Kurds . Meanwhile , hundreds of Sunni Arabs in Ramadi and Kirkuk marched against the possibility of a federal Iraq , saying they want a strong central government . If completed by Monday , the new constitution will be voted on in an October referendum . A U.S. bankruptcy court is considering whether it has jurisdiction in a case filed by the embattled Russian oil giant Yukos . Yukos filed the case with the court in Houston , Texas last year to stop a Russian court-ordered auction of its key production unit , Yuganskneftgaz . The U.S. court issued an injunction against the sale , but it went on anyway . Yukos assets in the United States are bank accounts and a home owned by the company 's financial chief . Yukos is now suing Russian energy firms including the natural gas giant Gazprom and the state-owned Rosneft for $ 20 billion in damages . A planned merger between Gazprom and Rosneft has been put on hold to wait for the decision from the U.S. court . The Turkish Weightlifting Federation has been fined $ 1,00,000 and suspended from all international competitions until May 31 following a series of anti-doping violations . Critics call the Russian government probe of Yukos politically motivated because former Yukos chief Mikhail Khodorkovsky had supported the opposition . The Kremlin says Yukos owes billions in back taxes . ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS Inc. said it plans to raise 175 million to 180 million Canadian dollars ( US $ 148.9 million to $ 153.3 million ) through a private placement of perpetual preferred shares .

A spokesman for the Toronto cable television and telecommunications concern said the coupon rate has n't yet been fixed , but will probably be set at around 8 % . He declined to discuss other terms of the issue . Despite its small size and limited natural resources , Liechtenstein has developed into a prosperous , highly industrialized , free-enterprise economy with a vital financial service sector and likely the second highest per capita income in the world . The Liechtenstein economy is widely diversified with a large number of small businesses . Low business taxes - the maximum tax rate is 20 % - and easy incorporation rules have induced many holding companies to establish nominal offices in Liechtenstein providing 30 % of state revenues . A Washington-based research institute says Pakistan is building a nuclear reactor that could produce enough plutonium for 40 to 50 nuclear weapons a year . In a statement Tuesday after a meeting in Doha , Qatar , the International Weightlifting Federation 's executive committee sanctioned Turkey 's federation for \" bringing the sport of weightlifting into disrepute . \" The country participates in a customs union with Switzerland and uses the Swiss franc as its national currency . It imports more than 90 % of its energy requirements . Liechtenstein has been a member of the European Economic Area ( an organization serving as a bridge between the European Free Trade Association ( EFTA ) and the EU ) since May 1995 . The government is working to harmonize its economic policies with those of an integrated Europe . In 2008 , Liechtenstein came under renewed international pressure - particularly from Germany - to improve transparency in its banking and tax systems . In December 2008 , Liechtenstein signed a Tax Information Exchange Agreement with the US . Upon Liechtenstein 's conclusion of 12 bilateral information-sharing agreements , the OECD in October 2009 removed the principality from its \" grey list \" of countries that had yet to implement the organization 's Model Tax Convention . By the end of 2010 , Liechtenstein had signed 25 Tax Information Exchange Agreements or Double Tax Agreements . Uruguay 's economy is characterized by an export-oriented agricultural sector , a well-educated work force , and high levels of social spending . Following financial difficulties in the late 1990s and early 2000s , economic growth for Uruguay averaged 8 % annually during the period 2004 - 8 . The fine must be paid before Turkey can be readmitted to the sport 's International Federation , with the money to be used for anti-doping activities . The 2008 - 9 global financial crisis put a brake on Uruguay 's vigorous growth , which decelerated to 2.9 % in 2009 . Nevertheless , the country managed to avoid a recession and keep positive growth rates , mainly through higher public expenditure and investment , and GDP growth exceeded 8 % in 2010 . Since 1997 , Sudan has been working with the IMF to implement macroeconomic reforms including a managed float of the exchange rate and a large reserve of foreign exchange . A new currency , the Sudanese Pound , was introduced in January 2007 at an initial exchange rate of $ 1 equals 2 Sudanese Pounds . Sudan began exporting crude oil in the last quarter of 1999 and the economy boomed on the back of increases in oil production , high oil prices , and significant inflows of foreign direct investment until the second half of 2008 . The Darfur conflict , the aftermath of two decades of civil war in the south , the lack of basic infrastructure in large areas , and a reliance by much of the population on subsistence agriculture ensure much of the population will remain at or below the poverty line for years to come despite rapid rises in average per capita income . Sudan 's real GDP expanded by 5.2 % during 2010 , an improvement over 2009 's 4.2 % growth but significantly below the more than 10 % per year growth experienced prior to the global financial crisis in 2006 and 2007 . While the oil sector continues to drive growth , services and utilities play an increasingly important role in the economy with agriculture production remaining important as it employs 80 % of the work force and contributes a third of GDP . In the lead up to the referendum on southern secession , which took place in January 2011 , Sudan saw its currency depreciate considerably on the black market with the Central Bank 's official rate also losing value as the Sudanese people started to hoard foreign currency . The Central Bank of Sudan intervened heavily in the currency market to defend the value of the pound and the Sudanese government introduced a number of measures to restrain excess local demand for hard currency , but uncertainty about the secession has meant that foreign exchange remains in heavy demand . The IWF also directed the Turkish Federation to identify and sanction athletes and coaches involved in the violations , and develop an anti-doping education program to be approved and monitored by the world body 's executive board . The Swiss Confederation was founded in 1291 as a defensive alliance among three cantons . In succeeding years , other localities joined the original three . The Swiss Confederation secured its independence from the Holy Roman Empire in 1499 . A constitution of 1848 , subsequently modified in 1874 , replaced the confederation with a centralized federal government . Switzerland 's sovereignty and neutrality have long been honored by the major European powers , and the country was not involved in either of the two world wars . The political and economic integration of Europe over the past half century , as well as Switzerland 's role in many UN and international organizations , has strengthened Switzerland 's ties with its neighbors . However , the country did not officially become a UN member until 2002 . Switzerland remains active in many UN and international organizations but retains a strong commitment to neutrality . A CROW was jealous of the Raven , because he was considered a bird of good omen and always attracted the attention of men , who noted by his flight the good or evil course of future events . Seeing some travelers approaching , the Crow flew up into a tree , and perching herself on one of the branches , cawed as loudly as she could . Brazil 's president is pledging to invest at least $ 1.7 billion to develop Rio de Janeiro 's slums . The travelers turned towards the sound and wondered what it foreboded , when one of them said to his companion , \" Let us proceed on our journey , my friend , for it is only the caw of a crow , and her cry , you know , is no omen . \" Those who assume a character which does not belong to them , only make themselves ridiculous . A RICH MAN lived near a Tanner , and not being able to bear the unpleasant smell of the tan-yard , he pressed his neighbor to go away . The Tanner put off his departure from time to time , saying that he would leave soon . But as he still continued to stay , as time went on , the rich man became accustomed to the smell , and feeling no manner of inconvenience , made no further complaints . A FARMER who had a deadly and implacable hatred against a certain Fox , caught him and tied some tow to his tail ; then carrying him to the centre of his own grain-field , set the tow on fire and let the animal go . \" Alas ! \" said the Farmer , seeing the result ; \" if that grain had not been heavily insured , I might have had to dissemble my hatred of the Fox . \" SOME BOYS , playing near a pond , saw a number of Frogs in the water and began to pelt them with stones . They killed several of them , when one of the Frogs , lifting his head out of the water , cried out : \" Pray stop , my boys : what is sport to you , is death to us . \" - \" One man 's pleasure may be another 's pain . \" - In a speech on Monday , Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said the state should meet its obligations to slum dwellers or else drug traffickers will take over the shantytowns . Softball is better than baseball because the Seventh Inning Stretch means stand up and go home . Math is like love ; a simple idea , but it can get complicated . I 'm not saying that the customer service in my bank is bad , but when I went in the other day and asked the clerk to check my balance ... she leaned over and pushed me . A priest who was walking through a small town saw a blackboard outside the front door of a school . It had been washed and put out to dry in the open air . There was a piece of chalk at the foot of the blackboard . The priest took the chalk and wrote in large letters , \" I 'm a priest and I pray for you all . \" A lawyer happened to pass next and when he saw what the priest had written , he added under it , \" I 'm a lawyer and I defend you all . \" Then , a doctor came by , took the piece of chalk , and wrote on the blackboard , \" I 'm a doctor and I cure you all . \" Finally , an ordinary citizen stopped , looked at what the others had written , thought for a few seconds and then added , \" I am an ordinary citizen and I pay for you all . \" He added that Brazil can defeat organized crime only if the government improves the country 's poorest areas . A strain of the bird flu virus that can spread to humans has been found among poultry in northern Nigeria . The Paris-based World Organization for Animal Health says it found a \" highly pathogenic \" version of the H5N1 strain at a chicken farm in the village of Jaji in Kaduna state . This is the first reported case of H5N1 in Africa . The organization says Nigerian authorities have disinfected the premises , and imposed a quarantine and restrictions on the movement of animals . It says it plans to coordinate a joint response to the situation with the U.N. 's Food and Agriculture Organization . Avian flu has killed or forced the slaughter of millions of birds over the last two years . The H5N1 strain has killed at least 88 people in seven countries , mostly in Asia , since late 2003 . The European Parliament has endorsed next week 's planned start of European Union membership talks with Turkey . However , lawmakers on Wednesday also postponed ratifying Turkey 's customs accord with the European Union because of Turkey 's continued refusal to recognize Cyprus , which gained EU membership last year . Also , the European Parliament passed a non-binding resolution calling on Turkey to recognize the massacre of hundreds of thousands of Armenians under the Ottoman Empire as a genocide . Mr. da Silva spoke a few days after a police raid on drug gangs killed at least 13 people in a slum . Armenia says 1.5 million Armenians were slaughtered by the Turks 90 years ago during the final years of the Ottoman Empire . Turkey says 3,00,000 Armenians and thousands of Turks were killed during an Armenian uprising . Police in Afghanistan say suspected Taleban militants have kidnapped four Afghan aid workers in the eastern part of the country . A provincial police chief General Abdul Hanan Raufi said Monday the four aid workers , employed by the International Organization for Migration , were abducted Sunday in eastern Paktia province . He said elders in the area are involved in negotiating for their release . Farther east , the U.-S.-led coalition force says troops captured a known al-Qaida terrorist and five other extremists Monday during an operation near the city of Khost . A military statement did not identify the captured men , but said the troops found grenades , military equipment , armor-piercing rounds and assault rifles during a search of the compound where the men were caught . Russia 's foreign minister says Moscow will let NATO take armored vehicles through its territory to Afghanistan under an expanded transit deal . Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told a news conference in Moscow Thursday that the opening of the Russian route applies to vehicles with anti-mine protection . NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen announced last week at a NATO-Russia Council meeting that Russia had agreed to increase its cooperation on the war in Afghanistan , allowing more equipment to be moved through the country to support NATO troops . The announced investment will provide basic services such as water and sewage systems , as well as basic facilities such as schools and hospitals . Russian President Dmitry Medvedev led the NATO-Russia Council talks in Lisbon . It was the first gathering of the 29-member group since April 2008 , just before Moscow 's brief war with Georgia , a Western ally . Tropical Storm Ophelia has headed northward , as residents of coastal North and South Carolina assess damage from the slow-moving storm . Thousands of homes and businesses remained without power Friday , despite the fact that the nation 's first hurricane since Katrina never officially made landfall . Experts say the Category 1 hurricane caused power outages , flooded streets , and significant damage to buildings because it moved slowly , battering the same area for two days and dumping dozens of centimeters of rain . As Ophelia continues to weaken and move northward , tropical storm watches are in effect for parts of the northeastern U.S. state of Massachusetts and the Canadian province of Nova Scotia . A remote-controlled bomb ripped through the vehicle of an influential pro-government figure in southern Afghanistan Friday , wounding several people and killing at least two others .

Naqib also was a commander during the resistance to the Soviet occupation in the 1980s . Witnesses say two bystanders also were killed . The money is expected to benefit two million families in the state and city of Rio de Janeiro . In separate news , authorities in northern Afghanistan say police Friday detained eight suspects in connection with Thursday 's killing of a German aid worker . It is not clear if the suspects were militants or bandits . The foreign aid worker was killed when gunmen attacked his vehicle in Sari Pul province . The assailants robbed three Afghan nationals traveling with him . A study indicates that the average level of nicotine in cigarettes has risen 10 percent in the past six years , making it harder for smokers to quit . The health department for the state of Massachusetts released a study this week . It shows how much nicotine content has changed and how much nicotine smokers inhale when they smoke . The study said cigarettes in 2004 yielded the smoker nearly 10 percent more nicotine per cigarette than in 1998 . The increase in nicotine levels varied by brand , with some increasing as much as 30 percent . Fifty two out of 116 brands studied had nicotine increases of more than 10 percent . Brazil 's federal , state , and municipal governments will all contribute to the fund . Health experts say higher nicotine content makes cigarettes more addictive and smoking harder to quit . U.S. tobacco companies have not commented on the study . Turkey has sent more troops and tanks to the Iraqi border , as speculation grows about a possible Turkish incursion against Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq . Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan says his patience has run out for the United States and Iraq to take action against the Kurdish rebels . But U.S. officials have expressed concerns that a cross-border operation could destabilize northern Iraq . Meanwhile , Turkish security forces continue large-scale operations against the Kurdistan Worker 's Party , or PKK , rebels in southeast Turkey . A Turkish soldier in the region was killed Wednesday by a landmine blast . Pressure for action against the PKK is mounting as Turkey prepares for national elections on July 22 , and after two bombings last week . The PKK has been fighting for autonomy in Turkey 's mainly Kurdish southeast since 1984 . The United States , the European Union and Turkey classify the PKK as a terrorist group . The Institute for Science and International Security reports that satellite photos show a possible construction site for a larger nuclear reactor near the small one in the Khushab district of Punjab province .

Reuters quotes Japan 's foreign minister today saying Tokyo 's patience on North Korea 's decision is running out . Nobutaka Machimura told the news agency that Japan is neither optimistic nor pessimistic about the talks resuming anytime soon . Former Sudanese President Jaafar Nimeiri - who imposed strict lslamic law on Sudan - has died . A statement from Sudan 's presidential office says the 79-year-old former leader died from an unspecified illness . It says he will be buried on Sunday in Omdurman near the capital , Khartoum . Mr. Nimeiri came to power in a coup in 1969 and served for 16 years until he too was ousted by a coup in 1985 while visiting the United States . Now , hundreds of Red Cross chapters nationwide are getting ready for the next group of storms . President Nimeiri imposed Islamic Sharia on Sudan in 1983 , a move that alienated the largely non-Muslim south , and is widely viewed as the catalyst for the nation 's 22-year civil war . Following his ouster , Mr. Nimeiri lived in exile in Egypt . He returned to Sudan in 1999 . The Nigerian military has fired on several barges it says were being used by oil smugglers in the Niger Delta region . A helicopter gunship carried out the attack Wednesday in Delta state , near the city of Warri . It was the first known assault by Nigeria 's military in the Delta since local militants carried out a series of attacks against the oil industry , including the kidnapping of four foreign oil workers last month . A local group known as the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta condemned the helicopter strike , saying it targeted ethnic Ijaw communities . The group alleges the helicopter took off from an civilian airstrip operated by Royal Dutch Shell . It threatened to shoot down aircraft using the strip if Nigeria 's military uses it again .

The first witness to appear in person at the trial of Saddam Hussein has given graphic testimony about the 1982 killing of more than 140 people in a mainly Shi'ite town . Ahmed Mohammed Hassem said he knew several people killed in Dujail after an assassination attempt on Saddam there . His testimony was interrupted by exchanges with one of Saddam 's seven co-defendants - his half-brother Barzan Ibrahim . Before the judge adjourned proceedings , Saddam told the court he is not afraid of execution . He earlier yelled out \" long live Iraq , long live the Arab state . \" Court officials say the trial will resume Tuesday . Also Monday , one of Saddam 's lawyers , former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark , demanded better security for defense lawyers , two of whom have been killed . On Sunday , Iraqi authorities said they had foiled an insurgent plot to bomb the trial during Monday 's proceedings . U.S. Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama has proposed a clampdown on energy speculation which he believes is responsible for record-high oil prices . Kid Rock wo n't face charges after a woman claimed he pushed her headfirst into a snowbank after a night of drinking . The 36-year-old rock singer - real name Bob Ritchie - now says he 'll sue the 28-year-old woman for filing a FALSE police report . She alleged that Kid Rock roughed her up after meeting her and a male friend at a bar in the Midwestern state of Michigan , and then inviting them to his house . Prosecutors said March 16 that insufficient evidence existed to charge Kid Rock with a crime . Kid Rock made headlines last year after marrying - and divorcing - actress Pamela Anderson in a four-month span . Rival factions in Kenya have clashed again in an increasingly violent campaign over a constitutional referendum , as authorities appealed for calm and vowed to punish anyone provoking unrest . Police say Thursday 's riot in the central town of Garissa began when supporters of the referendum tried to disrupt a rally held by opponents of the constitution . Police restored order after the crowd hurled rocks , bananas - the ballot symbol for a \" yes \" vote - and oranges , representing a \" no \" vote . At least one person was injured . Kenyans are to vote on a new proposed constitution in a national referendum on November 21 . Senator Obama Sunday announced the proposal , which would close a legal provision that exempts energy commodies from government oversight . The 197-page document allows Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki to retain his wide-ranging powers . Opponents say it fails to establish a strong prime ministerial post , which they argue is needed to balance the president 's authority . Election officials in East Timor say there were many \" inconsistencies \" in the country 's presidential election last Monday . The reported inconsistencies range from poor organization to discrepancies between the number of voters and the votes cast . Several districts , including the capital , Dili , had problems . A spokesman for the National Electoral Commission Martinho Gusmao told a news conference Friday that voting officials have just 72 hours to resolve the issues before official results are announced on Monday . Election officials have rejected a request from several candidates for a recount . Unofficial results show ruling party Prime Minister Jose Ramos-Horta and parliament chief Francisco \" Lu Olo \" Guterres will be competing in a runoff election . East Timor has been struggling to strengthen its democracy since voting for independence from Indonesia in 1999 . Police in Kenya have detained a Somali minister and two lawmakers for their role in a bloody brawl that broke out during a parliamentary session of the Somali government-in-exile . The American Diabetes Association reports the disease is the leading cause of new cases of blindness among adults . Critics say the deregulation measure , signed in 2000 by then-President Bill Clinton , opened the way to uncontrolled speculation in the oil markets . The fight on Thursday took place during a contentious vote over the deployment of peacekeepers to Somalia . Television footage showed lawmakers beating each other with walking sticks and throwing chairs and books at each other at a hotel in Nairobi where parliament is meeting . Police say one of those detained is Somali trade minister , Musa Sudi Yalahow . Somali lawmakers are divided over whether to allow peacekeepers into Somalia from bordering countries . Friday , East African officials attempted to defuse the situation , saying the first group of peacekeepers would only come from countries that do not border Somalia . The World Health Organization has confirmed Burma 's first human case of bird flu . Based on information provided by the Burmese Ministry of Health , the WHO identified the victim as a seven-year-old girl from eastern Shan State . Officials say she developed symptoms of the disease last month in an area where there had been an outbreak of the H5N1 virus in poultry . The girl survived the disease . Seven countries in East Asia have reported human cases of the potentially deadly H5N1 virus . The price of gasoline has become a campaign issue between Obama and presumptive Republican nominee John McCain . The two with the greatest number of cases are Indonesia and Vietnam . More than 200 people in 13 countries have died from the disease since 2003 . A second group that says it has links to the al-Qaida terrorist network has claimed responsibility for Thursday 's attacks in London . Injured tube passengers are escorted away from Edgware Road Tube Station in London following explosion , Thursday A group calling itself the \" Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigades \" posted a statement on an Arabic language Islamist website Saturday , congratulating itself for the bombings on three subway trains and one bus in the central part of the British capital . The same group also claimed responsibility for the March , 2004 Madrid train bombings that killed nearly 200 people . Just hours after Thursday 's bombings , a group calling itself \" The Secret Organization of al-Qaida in Europe \" issued a statement on another Arabic language Islamist website claiming responsibility for the attacks . Neither claim has been verified . Britain says it will extradite a computer expert to the United States to face terrorism charges . Home Secretary Charles Clarke says he has agreed to extradite 31-year-old British citizen Babar Ahmad , who is accused of running web sites in support of the al-Qaida terrorist network , Afghanistan 's ousted Taleban regime and Russia 's Chechen separatists . Mr. Ahmad has been in jail since his arrest in August 2004 under a U.S. arrest warrant . Senator McCain wants Congress to lift a ban on offshore oil drilling , while Obama says such a measure would not help the problem in the short term . New British laws allow the United States to seek the extradition of someone without presenting any evidence . A British court ruled earlier this year that Mr. Ahmad should be extradited after the United States promised he would not be labeled an \" enemy combatant \" and imprisoned in the U.S. naval base on Guantanamo Bay , Cuba . The case was then passed on to Mr. Clarke . Mr. Ahmad 's family is denouncing the decision , and promises to appeal . Kurdish witnesses in northwestern Iran say security forces killed at least 11 Kurdish demonstrators in a clash Wednesday in the city of Saqiz . Witnesses tell VOA that government buildings in the town were damaged in the clash . They say police are heavily deployed across Saqiz . The Iranian government has not commented on the reports . The protest and clash are the latest in a wave of violence across Kurdish areas of Iran following last month 's killing of a Kurdish activist by Iranian security forces . A North Korean patrol boat crossed briefly into South Korean waters Sunday to seize a Chinese fishing boat that had been illegally fishing in the North . Obama 's announcement concides with a major energy summit in Saudi Arabia on ways to rein in the high oil prices . The patrol boat sped nearly two kilometers into the southern section of the Yellow Sea , notifying the South Korean navy that it was tracking an illegal fishing boat . South Korea 's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement , the South Korean navy radioed a warning about the border crossing , and 25 minutes later the patrol boat crossed back into North Korean waters . The Yellow Sea , on the western side of the Korean Peninsula , has been the scene of deadly North and South confrontations in recent years . The two sides have established a radio protocol to prevent future clashes . Activists from the environmental group Greenpeace displayed dead whales and dolphins in front of Berlin 's famed Brandenburg Gate Monday to demonstrate why it believes a whale hunting moratorium should continue . Greenpeace says it found the dead mammals on various European beaches , saying some drowned while trapped in fisherman 's nets while others were badly wounded in collisions with ships . Greenpeace marine biologist Stefanie Werner says 3,00,000 whales and dolphins drown in fishing nets every year and many others die from pollution , accidents with ships , or from the effects of global warming . She asked how can pro-whaling nations justify hunting them ? The International Whaling Commission meets next week in Anchorage , Alaska , where Iceland , Japan , and Norway are expected to push to end a worldwide ban on commercial whaling . Whaling is a tradition and an industry for many in those countries . The teenage boy at the center of the latest Michael Jackson scandal says the pop star sexually molested him twice in the singer 's bedroom . Police in Nepal 's capital have arrested a senior opposition party official ahead of a planned protest . Police detained Arjun Narsingh , spokesman of the Nepali Congress Party , outside the party 's offices in Kathmandu . Mr. Narsingh had called a party meeting to plan demonstrations on Friday - Nepal 's Democracy Day - against the new royal government . Nepal 's King Gyanendra dismissed the previous government and declared a state of emergency two weeks ago because of what he said was its failure to put down a growing Maoist rebellion . Outside Nepal the power grab has been widely criticized and several nations , including the United States , some EU countries and Nepal 's close ally India , have recalled their ambassadors for consultations . An Iranian news agency says authorities have reinstated 300 more candidates ahead of next month 's parliamentary elections , bringing the total reinstated in the past week to almost 600 . Iran 's official news agency , IRNA , quotes an official as saying the candidates ' names will be released later Saturday . Iran 's Interior Ministry banned more than 2,200 candidates , mostly reformists , from competing in the March 14 vote . Several days ago , Iran 's highest oversight body , the Guardian Council , said that it had reinstated 280 of those candidates . Iranian authorities can disqualify candidates who are not deemed as showing sufficient loyalty to Iran 's Islamic system . The accuser , who testified in a California court Thursday , was a 13-year old cancer patient at the time of the alleged incidents . Reformists and conservatives have strongly criticized the mass disqualifications , warning that they undermine the election process . British Prime Minister Tony Blair has again defended plans to toughen anti-terrorism laws and detain suspects for three months without charge . Mr. Blair told his monthly news conference in London that police have made compelling arguments to extend the length of detention from its current two weeks . He says authorities are fighting a new kind of terrorism , which requires more time to investigate and often the cooperation of foreign agencies . But civil rights activists and opposition politicians say the changes are counterproductive and will undermine efforts by authorities to get more cooperation from Britain 's Muslim community . Mr. Blair proposed the new laws , which would also allow authorities to deport extremists , after the July 7 suicide bombings in London that killed 52 people . Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez warns that he will not renew the license of a television station he accuses of backing a failed coup against him in 2002 . Mr. Chavez said in a speech Thursday to the military that the concession for Radio Caracas Television will end in March . Earlier , the information minister , William Lara , said the broadcaster 's license would expire next May . Mr. Chavez also said he will not tolerate any media outlets that support efforts to remove him from power . Mr. Jackson had invited him and his family for a visit in 2003 . There was no immediate response from the Caracas-based station . President Chavez has repeatedly denounced RCTV and other pro-opposition broadcasters for what he says is overly critical coverage of his government . The press rights group Reporters Without Borders has urged Venezuela to end its efforts to shut down RCTV . The death toll from Saturday 's collapse of a metal exposition hall roof in the southern Polish city of Katowice continues to climb . Officials now say they have pulled at least 26 bodies from the rubble . A spokesman for the government of the Silesia region , where Katowice is located , said another 130 were injured . Police say about 500 people from Poland and other countries across Europe were inside the facility attending a homing pigeon exhibition . Officials say several foreigners were believed to be among the casualties , but there are conflicting reports about their nationalities and condition . Officials say the collapse was likely the result of the weight of snow on the roof after heavy snows and an arctic freeze that swept through Poland and neighboring countries this week . Temperatures plunged to minus 15 degrees Celsius as rescue efforts continued . The teen also testified that the entertainer urged him to drink wine aboard his private jet and hard liquor at the singer 's ranch . Israeli troops and tanks entered the northern Gaza Strip Sunday , hours after Israel ended an operation against Palestinian militants in southern Gaza . The Beit Hanoun operation began soon after Israeli forces withdrew from Khan Younis after a three-day assault . Israel says both raids were aimed at stopping militants from firing rockets and mortar shells at Israeli settlements and towns . The Israeli military actions come one week before Palestinian elections to replace the late Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat . A new opinion survey by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research shows Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Mahmoud Abbas with a 65-to-22 percent lead over his nearest rival , Mustafa Barghouti . Mr. Abbas has vowed to protect Palestinian militants from Israeli raids . He also has criticized attacks on Israelis , saying they are not productive . An auction house in Hong Kong has broken the price-per-carat record for a gemstone auctioned off , with the sale of a six-carat blue diamond at nearly $ 8 million . Sotheby 's of Hong Kong announced the sale Monday , noting that the price comes out to $ 1.32 million a carat . The sale bested a 20-year record held by a diamond known as the \" Hancock Red \" that fetched just over $ 9,00,000 per carat in 1987 . Mr. Jackson has denied all the charges against him . The buyer for the diamond is Moussaieff Jewelers , a London-based jeweler that collects rare gemstones . The diamond is said to be in perfect condition with a rare , vivid blue color - the result of the element boron in the stone 's crystal structure . The Iraqi government 's top executive body , called the president 's council , has issued a controversial law that allows some former members of Saddam Hussein 's Baath Party to return to government service . The Kurdish , Jalal Talabani , and Shi'ite , Adel Abdul-Mahdi , representatives of the three-member presidency council issued the law Sunday despite the objection of the Sunni representative , Tareq al-Hashemi . Sunni politicians say the law contains provisions that will force out many current government workers . The law is one of 18 pieces of so-called benchmark legislation aimed at achieving reconciliation among Iraq 's Kurdish , Sunni Arab and Shi'ite communities . Meanwhile , the U.S. military says the bodies of four Iraqi militia members working with U.S. forces were recovered in Baquba Sunday . The military also said coalition forces killed three suspected terrorists and captured 36 others in the last two days in operations in central and northern Iraq . Bosnian officials say DNA tests on human remains taken from mass graves have identified 50 victims of the war in Croatia in the early 1990s . Experts in Bosnian and Croatian laboratories compared the DNA with blood samples taken from more than 750 families who have reported missing relatives . Thursday 's testimony came after the judge threatened to jail Mr. Jackson and revoke his bail when he arrived more than one hour late for court . Fifty of the samples led to positive identifications . A Bosnian official calls the results extraordinary . The Sarajevo-based International Commission for Missing Persons runs one of the world 's most sophisticated DNA laboratories The lab helped identify victims of the September 11 , 2001 terror attacks on the United States and last year 's Asian tsunami . The United States has announced it is giving $ 40 million worth of food aid to Bangladesh , which is facing shortages after flooding and a devastating cyclone last year . U.S. Ambassador to Bangladesh James Moriarty said Sunday in Dhaka the aid will go to school children , along with cyclone and flood victims . Last year 's Cyclone Sidr killed an estimated 3,500 people and left another two million homeless . The cyclone also destroyed roughly two million tons of rice . The Bangladeshi government has said this year 's rice crop looks like it will be plentiful , but it is still anticipating possible rice shortages . Bermuda enjoys the third highest per capita income in the world , more than 50 % higher than that of the US ; the average cost of a house by the mid-2000s exceeded $ 10,00,000 . An official with the German firm Bilfinger Berger , Thomas Horbach , said the gunmen stopped the supply boat Wednesday as it sailed from Delta State to Bayelsa State to inspect an offshore oil field owned by Royal-Dutch Shell . It is the leading cause of kidney failure . A Jackson spokesman said the star had been hospitalized for a serious back injury . Its economy is primarily based on providing financial services for international business and luxury facilities for tourists . A number of reinsurance companies relocated to the island following the 11 September 2001 attacks and again after Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 contributing to the expansion of an already robust international business sector . Bermuda 's tourism industry - which derives over 80 % of its visitors from the US - continues to struggle but remains the island 's number two industry . Most capital equipment and food must be imported . Bermuda 's industrial sector is largely focused on construction and agriculture is limited , with only 20 % of the land being arable . The former French colony of Ubangi-Shari became the Central African Republic upon independence in 1960 . After three tumultuous decades of misrule - mostly by military governments - civilian rule was established in 1993 and lasted for one decade . President Ange-Felix PATASSE 's civilian government was plagued by unrest , and in March 2003 he was deposed in a military coup led by General Francois BOZIZE , who established a transitional government . Though the government has the tacit support of civil society groups and the main parties , a wide field of candidates contested the municipal , legislative , and presidential elections held in March and May of 2005 in which General BOZIZE was affirmed as president . The government still does not fully control the countryside , where pockets of lawlessness persist . Pakistan has denied allegations by Moscow that militants have been training on Pakistani territory to carry out terrorist attacks in Russia and the former Soviet central Asian nations . Unrest in the neighboring nations of Chad , Sudan , and the DRC continues to affect stability in the Central African Republic as well . The Gilbert Islands became a British protectorate in 1892 and a colony in 1915 ; they were captured by the Japanese in the Pacific War in 1941 . The islands of Makin and Tarawa were the sites of major US amphibious victories over entrenched Japanese garrisons in 1943 . The Gilbert Islands were granted self-rule by the UK in 1971 and complete independence in 1979 under the new name of Kiribati . The US relinquished all claims to the sparsely inhabited Phoenix and Line Island groups in a 1979 treaty of friendship with Kiribati . Spain 's mixed capitalist economy is the 12th largest in the world , and its per capita income roughly matches that of Germany and France . However , after almost 15 years of above average GDP growth , the Spanish economy began to slow in late 2007 and entered into a recession in the second quarter of 2008 . GDP contracted by 3.7 % in 2009 , ending a 16-year growth trend , and by another 0.2 % in 2010 , making Spain the last major economy to emerge from the global recession . The reversal in Spain 's economic growth reflected a significant decline in construction amid an oversupply of housing and falling consumer spending , while exports actually have begun to grow . Government efforts to boost the economy through stimulus spending , extended unemployment benefits , and loan guarantees did not prevent a sharp rise in the unemployment rate , which rose from a low of about 8 % in 2007 to 20 % in 2010 . Foreign ministry spokesman Jalil Abbas Jilani in Islamabad Saturday said there are no militant training facilities in Pakistan . The government budget deficit worsened from 3.8 % of GDP in 2008 to 9.2 % of GDP in 2010 , more than three times the euro-zone limit . Spain 's large budget deficit and poor economic growth prospects have made it vulnerable to financial contagion from other highly-indebted euro zone members despite the government 's efforts to cut spending , privatize industries , and boost competitiveness through labor market reforms . Spanish banks ' high exposure to the collapsed domestic construction and real estate market also poses a continued risk for the sector . The government oversaw a restructuring of the savings bank sector in 2010 , and provided some $ 15 billion in capital to various institutions . Investors remain concerned that Madrid may need to bail out more troubled banks . The Bank of Spain , however , is seeking to boost confidence in the financial sector by pressuring banks to come clean about their losses and consolidate into stronger groups . A CROW in great want of food saw a Serpent asleep in a sunny nook , and flying down , greedily seized him . The Serpent , turning about , bit the Crow with a mortal wound . In the agony of death , the bird exclaimed : \" O unhappy me ! who have found in that which I deemed a happy windfall the source of my destruction . \" He said the role and sacrifices made by Islamabad , a key U.S. ally in the war on terror , have been acknowledged by the international community . AT ONE TIME the Horse had the plain entirely to himself . Then a Stag intruded into his domain and shared his pasture . The Horse , desiring to revenge himself on the stranger , asked a man if he were willing to help him in punishing the Stag . The man replied that if the Horse would receive a bit in his mouth and agree to carry him , he would contrive effective weapons against the Stag . The Horse consented and allowed the man to mount him . From that hour he found that instead of obtaining revenge on the Stag , he had enslaved himself to the service of man . THE people of Madagonia had an antipathy to the people of Novakatka and set upon some sailors of a Novakatkan vessel , killing two and wounding twelve . The King of Madagonia having refused either to apologise or pay , the King of Novakatka made war upon him , saying that it was necessary to show that Novakatkans must not be slaughtered . In the battles which ensued the people of Madagonia slaughtered two thousand Novakatkans and wounded twelve thousand . But the Madagonians were unsuccessful , which so chagrined them that never thereafter in all their land was a Novakatkan secure in property or life . His comments come one day after Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow had information that people are being trained in Afghanistan and Pakistan with the help of Taleban insurgents to carry out attacks inside Russia . Softball is better than baseball because you do n't have to watch your team lose for NINE innings . Ukraine 's Supreme Court has halted official publication of the results of the December 26 presidential election . The high court announced Tuesday it must first review an appeal from former Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych , who officials say lost the race to opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko . The results must be printed in two government newspapers before the winner can be inaugurated . Election officials say Mr. Yushchenko garnered 52 percent support in the court-ordered repeat election , over Mr. Yanukovych 's 44 percent . The former prime minister is alleging widespread fraud in the hotly contested race , and has filed a number of complaints with the Supreme Court and electoral officials . The December election replaced a November run-off that the high court said was rigged in favor of Mr. Yanukovych . Top officials with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe have congratulated Mr. Yushchenko on the election . The child molestation trial of pop star Michael Jackson is set to begin in southern California . Lawyers are expected to begin screening the first of as many as 750 potential jurors at a Santa Barbara county court Monday for the trial that could last several months .

He has pleaded not guilty , saying he is completely innocent . In a court-approved video statement Sunday , Mr. Jackson criticized recent leaks of grand jury testimony on the case , calling them \" malicious , disgusting and FALSE . \" Grand jury testimony , although secret and not publicly released , is often leaked to the media . Russia 's President Vladimir Putin has made more harsh comments about the Bush administration , accusing it of using what he calls a \" nonexistent Russian threat \" to get more defense spending from Congress . Mr. Putin said during a visit to Jordan Tuesday that the administration has used the \" Russian card \" to address its political problems , including the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and for the deployment of a missile defense system . He said he only expressed what many other countries also believe , when he complained last week about what he described as the almost uncontained use of U.S. military force . The White House called his remarks disappointing . Last week , U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates spoke to a congressional committee and identified Russia as a potential threat . Two armed Pakistani inmates were holed up in Afghanistan 's main prison Friday , after an escape attempt that left at least five people dead . Jordan says it will host a regional conference next week to discuss ways to help hundreds of thousands of Iraqi refugees who have fled their country 's violence . The head of the Pul-i-Charki prison in the Afghan capital , Kabul , says four inmates linked to the al-Qaida terrorist network began the uprising Friday . The four men , identified as one Iraqi and three Pakistanis , overpowered and killed a prison guard and seized his rifle , then killed two more guards . Two of the original four prisoners died in a shootout . Reports from the scene say a shootout has been under way between the remaining two inmates and security forces surrounding the prison . The prison , on the outskirts of Kabul , is used to house inmates held for criminal offenses . It is separate from detention facilities operated by the United States to house captured Taliban and al-Qaida fighters . Iran 's intelligence minister says authorities have arrested members of a group which allegedly carried out an attack in northwestern Iran on Wednesday that killed 12 people . Heidar Moslehi did not publicly identify the group Thursday .

The bombing in the town of Mahabad came during a military parade marking the 30th anniversary of the start of the Iran-Iraq War . The state-owned Petra news agency said Thursday Jordan has invited officials from Syria , Egypt , Iraq , the Arab League and the United Nations to attend the meeting in Amman on July 26 . Officials say at least 70 others were injured in the blast . No group has claimed responsibility . Local officials blamed Kurdish separatists . But a leading Kurdish faction condemned the bombing . Former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani is in Iraq for talks on boosting political , religious and economic ties . Mr. Rafsanjani , who heads the influential Expediency Council , arrived Monday in Baghdad and met with Iraqi President Jalal Talabani . Mr. Talabani was in Iran last week , as the two former foes rebuild their ties following the ouster of Iranian arch-rival , former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein . Mr. Talabani was seeking Iranian investment in his country , devastated in the years since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 . Washington has expressed concern about increasing ties between the two Shi'ite-majority neighbors . It has accused Tehran of supporting anti-U.S. militants in Iraq , a charge Iran denies . Petra says representatives of Iran , Turkey , Russia and Japan also will take part as observers . About 7,000 Hamas supporters have held a rally in Gaza City to mark the anniversary of the assassination of the group 's founder and send a warning to Israel . Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin was killed in an Israeli air strike March 22 , last year . Hamas leaders Friday vowed to resume attacks on Israel unless it accepts their demands for prisoner releases and other concessions . A top Hamas official said he would participate in cease-fire talks scheduled next week in Egypt , but has not decided on whether the group will sign an agreement . Some palestinian militants have been observing a \" cooling off \" period with Israel that was agreed to during a recent summit in Sharm el-Sheik , Egypt . India and Sri Lanka say peace talks with Tamil rebels should resume early in order to prevent the island nation from plunging back into civil war . The call was made after visiting Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse met with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and briefed him about his government 's efforts to restart peace talks with Tamil Tiger rebels . An Indian spokesman said both countries agreed about the need to strengthen the almost three-year-old ceasefire , which is becoming fragile . Both the Tigers and the Sri Lankan government have agreed to hold talks , but the government insists they must take place in an Asian country , while the rebels want to hold them in Norway , which brokered a 2002 truce . In New Delhi , Mr. Rajapakse is also holding talks on enhancing economic cooperation and trade relations with India . It says the delegates will discuss how to ease the burden of countries hosting large numbers of Iraqi refugees . United Nations humanitarian agencies say they are searching for a new route into southern Lebanon to help war refugees , after Israel imposed an indefinite ban on movement in the region . A spokeswoman for the U.N. World Food Program , Christiane Berthiaume , said Tuesday relief agencies are looking for alternative ways to provide aid to Lebanese civilians cut off by heavy fighting . Aid officials say road transport is too dangerous after the Israeli military warned it would strike any vehicle traveling south of the Litani River on suspicion of transporting weapons . The U.N. spokeswoman said there are hundreds of thousands of people who need aid in Lebanon . The World Food Program has brought 404 tons of food into the region , but she said that is not enough .

One of the suspects , identified as radical Muslim Abu Izzadeen , was widely known in Britain for heckling Home Secretary John Reid last year in a televised public meeting . A spokesman , Anjem Choudary , for the banned Islamic militant group al-Ghurabaa confirmed Izzadeen 's arrest Tuesday . Izzadeen , a Muslim convert and former electrician , was arrested and released on bail earlier this year in a separate case alleging that he encouraged terrorism . Police say the suspects , aged between 21 and 35 , are in custody at a London police precinct . Authorities also say other searches in connection with the probe are ongoing .

Most of the victims came in contact with infected poultry . Demonstrators chanted slogans such as \" Loving Peace , Opposing Missiles , \" and \" Oppose Annexation . \" The rally comes amid this week 's one-year anniversary of China 's approval of an anti-secession law . The law says China will employ \" non-peaceful means \" to prevent Taiwan 's independence if efforts at peaceful reunification fail . Mr. Chen angered Beijing last month when he decided to stop funding a unification council and scrap guidelines for reunification with China . China and Taiwan split in 1949 after a civil war , but Beijing considers Taiwan a renegade province .

The International Monetary Fund says Haiti qualifies for partial cancellation of its debt . Takatoshi Kato , the IMF 's deputy managing director , said Tuesday that Haiti has an unsustainable amount of debt and therefore is eligible for assistance under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative . The impoverished country is struggling to manage roughly $ 1 billion in debt . The Fund said in July that under the IMF-World Bank initiative , Haiti could receive up to $ 14 million in credit in the first year and possibly additional contributions of $ 22 million .

Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf says India will allow leaders of Kashmir 's main separatist political alliance to visit Pakistan for talks on the disputed region 's future . Pakistan has invited an alliance of about two dozen Kashmiri separatist groups known as the All Parties Hurriyat Conference to visit on June 2 . India has previously denied permission to Hurriyat leaders to visit Pakistan , saying the Kashmir dispute is India 's internal matter . But in an interview with the Daily Times published Tuesday , General Musharraf speaks of a breakthrough , saying this time Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has allowed Hurriyat leaders to travel to Pakistan . He said once they talk to Pakistan and then India , there will be a trilateral arrangement going . There has been no word from New Delhi . It says the speaker is probably Adam Gadahn , a U.S. citizen wanted for questioning by the FBI for possible terrorist activity . General Musharraf met the Kashmiri separatist leaders last month during his visit to New Delhi .

A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue accused Japan of having , in her words , a \" Cold War mentality , \" adding that the scenarios were without merit . Japanese media reported Monday that a Japanese defense agency review presented three possibilities for Chinese action against Japan . It says China might take action to secure Chinese interests in a gas field in the East China Sea , to seize a disputed set of islands known as Daioyu in China and Senkaku in Japanto or to keep U.S. forces based in Japan from protecting Taiwan . Officials in both Los Angeles and Melbourne say the tape was meant to instill fear , and have advised residents to go about their normal lives . The Japanese report advises using diplomatic means to keep the situation stable . Some of this information provided by Reuters and AP .

Sao Tome 's prime minister , Damiao Vaz de Almeida , has resigned following contentious oil deals negotiated by the president . The Associated Press quotes Mr. Vaz de Almeida as saying he objected to President Fradique de Menezes awarding oil exploration deals to Nigerian companies , which he said were \" of doubtful credibility and inadequate technical ability . \" According to the report , Mr. Vaz de Almeida was angered by the president 's refusal to back the government this week during a major civil servants ' strike over pay . Mr. Vaz de Almeida had been in office for about eight months . The U.S. military says it has uncovered a large stockpile of weapons inside a Fallujah mosque led by a key insurgent leader . Two years ago , President Menezes was briefly removed from power in a bloodless coup by rebellious soldiers . They demanded more transparency in oil contracts , following the discovery of large oil reserves . A senior Iranian official has warned countries opposed to Tehran 's nuclear program that they will face retaliation if sanctions are imposed on Iran . Iran 's top nuclear negotiator , Ali Larijani , issued the warning in comments to reporters in Tehran Friday . Larijani said Western nations will face \" painful \" measures if the United Nations Security Council imposes sanctions on Iran for its nuclear program . The permanent U.N. Security Council members plus Germany are trying to reach agreement on a sanctions resolution . Iran ignored an August 31st UN deadline to suspend uranium enrichment . The U.S. and its western allies believe Iran 's enrichment activities are part of a program to develop nuclear weapons . Iran says its nuclear program is to produce energy , not weapons . A United Nations war crimes court has sentenced a former Rwandan administrator to 25 years in prison for his role in the country 's 1994 genocide . The military did not specify the number of weapons found , but called it the \" largest weapons cache to date in the city \" - a one-time rebel bastion . The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda , based in Tanzania , found Dominique Ntawukulilyayo guilty of genocide . Court prosecutors say Ntawukulilyayo , who was deputy administrator of Rwanda 's southern Gisagara district , transported soldiers to an area where thousands of Tutsis had taken refuge , leaving the soldiers to carry out a mass slaughter .

U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the extremist elements that once again attempted to disrupt the electoral process have failed . The countries agreed to reopen their consulates , following a meeting Friday between Panamanian President Martin Torrijos and Cuban Vice President Carlos Lage . U.S. and Iraqi government forces are continuing to sweep Fallujah after an assault on the city earlier this month . Pakistan 's Foreign Ministry said the completion of the electoral process in Afghanistan was a big step forward on the road to peace and stability , national reconstruction and development . The European Union , the United Nations and NATO hailed the election and praised those who voted . Afghan President Hamid Karzai called the election a defeat for terrorism . NATO 's secretary general says a proposed U.S. missile defense system in Europe risks splitting the alliance between those countries it would fully protect and those left vulnerable to threats . Jaap de Hoop Scheffer 's warning appeared Monday in an interview with the British newspaper , The Financial Times . Experts say the proposed missile system in Poland and the Czech Republic would shield most of Europe from any attacks from what Washington calls rogue states such as Iran or North Korea . But NATO officials told the newspaper that countries in southeastern Europe such as Turkey , Greece and Italy would need extra short-range missile protection because of their proximity to Iran . De Hoop Scheffer suggests that the proposed U.S. system could be complemented by NATO plans for a smaller , mobile system scheduled to become operational in 2010 . Venezuela 's ambassador to Washington is calling on the U.S. to extradite a Cuban militant accused of planning a deadly airplane bombing in 1976 . Ambassador Bernardo Alvarez told Venezuelan state television Monday the extradition of Luis Posada Carriles should not be considered an immigration issue . In southern Iraqi city of Basra , police said they arrested five Arab foreigners suspected of planning attacks . Carriles is a former CIA operative who is considered to be the mastermind behind the in-flight bombing of a Cubana Airlines plane that killed 73 people . He is being held in a detention center in the U.S. state of Texas for immigration violations . Alvarez called Carriles the \" Osama bin Laden \" of Latin America . He said he discussed the extradition request with U.S. Under Secretary of State Thomas Shannon last month . Venezuela 's government often clashes with Washington .

The latest results include some unusual write-downs , which had an after-tax impact of $ 4.9 million . Those included costs associated with the potential Valley Federal Savings and Loan Association acquisition , which was terminated on Sept. 27 , 1989 . In addition , operating results were hit by an increase in loan and real estate loss reserves . In American Stock Exchange composite trading , Citadel shares closed yesterday at $ 45.75 , down 25 cents . Oil-rich Nigeria has been hobbled by political instability , corruption , inadequate infrastructure , and poor macroeconomic management but in 2008 began pursuing economic reforms . Nigeria 's former military rulers failed to diversify the economy away from its overdependence on the capital-intensive oil sector , which provides 95 % of foreign exchange earnings and about 80 % of budgetary revenues . Following the signing of an IMF stand-by agreement in August 2000 , Nigeria received a debt-restructuring deal from the Paris Club and a $ 1 billion credit from the IMF , both contingent on economic reforms . Nigeria pulled out of its IMF program in April 2002 , after failing to meet spending and exchange rate targets , making it ineligible for additional debt forgiveness from the Paris Club . In November 2005 , Abuja won Paris Club approval for a debt-relief deal that eliminated $ 18 billion of debt in exchange for $ 12 billion in payments - a total package worth $ 30 billion of Nigeria 's total $ 37 billion external debt . European Union officials say transportation and other logistical problems are holding up some of the massive amounts of humanitarian aid European countries have offered to victims of Hurricane Katrina . Since 2008 the government has begun to show the political will to implement the market-oriented reforms urged by the IMF , such as modernizing the banking system , curbing inflation by blocking excessive wage demands , and resolving regional disputes over the distribution of earnings from the oil industry . GDP rose strongly in 2007 - 10 because of increased oil exports and high global crude prices in 2010 . President JONATHAN has pledged to continue the economic reforms of his predecessor with emphasis on infrastructure improvements . Infrastructure is the main impediment to growth and in August 2010 JONATHAN unveiled a power sector blueprint that includes privatization of the state-run electricity generation and distribution facilities . The government also is working toward developing stronger public-private partnerships for roads . Nigeria 's financial sector was hurt by the global financial and economic crises and the Central Bank governor has taken measures to strengthen that sector . Bahrain is one of the most diversified economies in the Persian Gulf . Highly developed communication and transport facilities make Bahrain home to numerous multinational firms with business in the Gulf . As part of its diversification plans , Bahrain implemented a Free Trade Agreement ( FTA ) with the US in August 2006 , the first FTA between the US and a Gulf state . Bahrain 's economy , however , continues to depend heavily on oil . In Brussels Tuesday , a spokeswoman for the European Commission said a Swedish plane loaded with food and water treatment tools was ready to take off , but had not received approval from Washington to enter U.S. airspace . Petroleum production and refining account for more than 60 % of Bahrain 's export receipts , 70 % of government revenues , and 11 % of GDP ( exclusive of allied industries ) . Other major economic activities are production of aluminum - Bahrain 's second biggest export after oil - finance , and construction . Bahrain competes with Malaysia as a worldwide center for Islamic banking and continues to seek new natural gas supplies as feedstock to support its expanding petrochemical and aluminum industries . Unemployment , especially among the young , is a long-term economic problem Bahrain struggles to address . In 2009 , to help lower unemployment among Bahraini nationals , Bahrain reduced sponsorship for expatriate workers , increasing the costs of employing foreign labor . The global financial crisis caused funding for many non-oil projects to dry up and resulted in slower economic growth for Bahrain . Other challenges facing Bahrain include the slow growth of government debt as a result of a large subsidy program , the financing of large government projects , and debt restructuring , such as the bailout of state-owned Gulf Air . San Marino 's economy relies heavily on its tourism and banking industries , as well as on the manufacture and export of ceramics , clothing , fabrics , furniture , paints , spirits , tiles , and wine . The per capita level of output and standard of living are comparable to those of the most prosperous regions of Italy , which supplies much of its food . The economy benefits from foreign investment due to its relatively low corporate taxes and low taxes on interest earnings . She said EU authorities have suggested to the Bush administration that aid could flow more easily if it was placed aboard military planes at U.S. air bases in Europe . San Marino has recently faced increased international pressure to improve cooperation with foreign tax authorities and transparency within its own banking sector , which generates about one-fifth of the country 's tax revenues . Italy 's implementation in October 2009 of a tax amnesty to repatriate untaxed funds held abroad has resulted in financial outflows from San Marino to Italy worth more than $ 4.5 billion . Such outflows , combined with a money-laundering scandal at San Marino 's largest financial institution and the recent global economic downturn , have contributed to a deep recession and growing budget deficit . Industrial production declined sharply in 2010 , especially in the textile sector . However , San Marino has little national debt , and an unemployment rate less than half the size of Italy 's . The San Marino government has adopted measures to counter the downturn , including subsidized credit to businesses . San Marino also continues to work towards harmonizing its fiscal laws with EU members and international standards . In September 2009 , the OECD removed San Marino from its list of tax havens that have yet to fully implement global tax standards , and in 2010 San Marino signed Tax Information Exchange Agreements with most major countries . The future of the country 's economy will be heavily influenced by the signing of a financial information exchange agreement with Italy , which many Italian investors see as fundamental for their business operations with San Marino . Revenues of this tiny island traditionally have come from exports of phosphates . More than 20 countries have offered emergency aid teams , tents , meals , water and aircraft to help in the massive relief effort . Few other resources exist , with most necessities being imported , mainly from Australia , its former occupier and later major source of support . In 2005 an Australian company entered into an agreement to exploit remaining supplies . Primary reserves of phosphates were exhausted and mining ceased in 2006 , but mining of a deeper layer of \" secondary phosphate \" in the interior of the island began the following year . The secondary phosphate deposits may last another 30 years . The rehabilitation of mined land and the replacement of income from phosphates are serious long-term problems . In anticipation of the exhaustion of Nauru 's phosphate deposits , substantial amounts of phosphate income were invested in trust funds to help cushion the transition and provide for Nauru 's economic future . As a result of heavy spending from the trust funds , the government faced virtual bankruptcy . To cut costs the government has frozen wages and reduced overstaffed public service departments . Nauru lost further revenue in 2008 with the closure of Australia 's refugee processing center , making it almost totally dependent on food imports and foreign aid . Housing , hospitals , and other capital plant are deteriorating . Meanwhile , U.S. officials say all aid flights from abroad will be directed to an Air Force base in Arkansas , before being sent to the devastated U.S. Gulf Coast . The cost to Australia of keeping the government and economy afloat continues to climb . Few comprehensive statistics on the Nauru economy exist with estimates of Nauru 's GDP varying widely . The French colonies of Senegal and the French Sudan were merged in 1959 and granted their independence as the Mali Federation in 1960 . The union broke up after only a few months . Senegal joined with The Gambia to form the nominal confederation of Senegambia in 1982 . The envisaged integration of the two countries was never carried out , and the union was dissolved in 1989 . The Movement of Democratic Forces in the Casamance ( MFDC ) has led a low-level separatist insurgency in southern Senegal since the 1980s , and several peace deals have failed to resolve the conflict . Nevertheless , Senegal remains one of the most stable democracies in Africa . Senegal was ruled by a Socialist Party for 40 years until current President Abdoulaye WADE was elected in 2000 . He was reelected in February 2007 and has amended Senegal 's constitution over a dozen times to increase executive power and to weaken the opposition , part of the president 's increasingly autocratic governing style . The United Nations nuclear agency says it has no information to support a recent media report of an undeclared nuclear facility in Syria . Senegal has a long history of participating in international peacekeeping and regional mediation . A CERTAIN HUNTER , having snared a hare , placed it upon his shoulders and set out homewards .

Several armed Palestinian factions have pledged to maintain calm during Wednesday 's Palestinian parliamentary elections . The groups , including Hamas and Fatah-linked al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades , say their militants will not be armed during the vote . Despite the pledge , a Fatah election worker was killed in the West Bank town of Nablus overnight . Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas called Tuesday for all Palestinians to take part in the election . Opinion polls show almost equal support for the militant group Hamas and Mr. Abbas ' Fatah . Both groups have indicated they would be ready to form a coalition after the vote . A top Hamas leader also suggested his group might agree to future negotiations with Israel through a third party . The information minister denied the rise was linked to fuel prices , blaming the increase on what he called greedy business people . Hamas has carried out dozens of suicide bombings and remains committed to Israel 's destruction . Israeli and U.S. officials call Hamas a terrorist organization . Health officials in China say the number of cholera cases reported on the southern island of Hainan has increased to 51 . China 's official Xinhua news agency reports the provincial health department saying that 29 of those affected have been treated and released from the hospital . No deaths from the outbreak have been reported . On Sunday , authorities sealed the campus of Hainan University after 70 students were hospitalized with intestinal problems . Health officials say the outbreak began at a village dinner party near Danzhou . They have blamed heavy floods for creating conditions ripe for the disease . Cholera is a water-borne disease , which starts with acute diarrhea and can lead to kidney failure . It is especially dangerous for young children . The largest U.S. supplier of parts for the automotive industry has filed for bankruptcy protection . Reed International PLC said that net income for the six months ended Oct. 1 slipped 5 % to # 89.7 million ( $ 141.9 million ) , or 16 pence a share , from # 94.8 million ( $ 149.9 million ) , or 17.3 pence a share . The British paper , packaging and publishing concern , said profit from continuing lines fell 10 % to # 118 million from # 130.6 million . While there were no one-time gains or losses in the latest period , there was a one-time gain of # 18 million in the 1988 period . And while there was no profit this year from discontinued operations , last year they contributed # 34 million , before tax . Pretax profit fell 3.7 % to # 128 million from # 133 million and was below analysts ' expectations of # 130 million to # 135 million , but shares rose 6 pence to 388 pence in early trading yesterday in London . Reed is paying an interim dividend of 4.6 pence , up 15 % from 4 pence a year earlier . Sales fell 20 % to # 722 million . Earnings were hurt by disposal of operations in its restructuring , Reed said . The German economy - the fifth largest economy in the world in PPP terms and Europe 's largest - is a leading exporter of machinery , vehicles , chemicals , and household equipment and benefits from a highly skilled labor force . Like its western European neighbors , Germany faces significant demographic challenges to sustained long-term growth . Delphi Corporation filed a motion with the federal bankruptcy court in New York Saturday to reorganize its U.S. operations . Low fertility rates and declining net immigration are increasing pressure on the country 's social welfare system and necessitate structural reforms . The modernization and integration of the eastern German economy - where unemployment can exceed 20 % in some municipalities - continues to be a costly long-term process , with annual transfers from west to east amounting in 2008 alone to roughly $ 12 billion . Reforms launched by the government of Chancellor Gerhard SCHROEDER ( 1998 - 2005 ) , deemed necessary to address chronically high unemployment and low average growth , contributed to strong growth in 2006 and 2007 and falling unemployment . These advances , as well as a government subsidized , reduced working hour scheme , help explain the relatively modest increase in unemployment during the 2008 - 9 recession - the deepest since World War II - and its decrease to 7.4 % in 2010 . GDP contracted 4.7 % in 2009 but grew by 3.6 % in 2010 . In its annual projection for 2011 , the Federal Government expects the upswing to continue , with GDP forecast to grow this year at a real rate of 2.3 % . The recovery was attributable primarily to rebounding manufacturing orders and exports - increasingly outside the Euro Zone . Domestic demand , however , is becoming more significant driver of Germany 's economic expansion . Stimulus and stabilization efforts initiated in 2008 and 2009 and tax cuts introduced in Chancellor Angela MERKEL 's second term increased Germany 's budget deficit to 3.3 % in 2010 . The Bundesbank expects the deficit to drop to about 2.5 % in 2011 , below the EU 's 3 % limit . Delphi , which split off from its former parent , General Motors , six years ago , recently failed to win financial concessions from unions . A constitutional amendment approved in 2009 likewise limits the federal government to structural deficits of no more than 0.35 % of GDP per annum as of 2016 . Two centuries of Viking raids into Europe tapered off following the adoption of Christianity by King Olav TRYGGVASON in 994 . Conversion of the Norwegian kingdom occurred over the next several decades . In 1397 , Norway was absorbed into a union with Denmark that lasted more than four centuries . In 1814 , Norwegians resisted the cession of their country to Sweden and adopted a new constitution . Sweden then invaded Norway but agreed to let Norway keep its constitution in return for accepting the union under a Swedish king . Rising nationalism throughout the 19th century led to a 1905 referendum granting Norway independence . Although Norway remained neutral in World War I , it suffered heavy losses to its shipping . Norway proclaimed its neutrality at the outset of World War II , but was nonetheless occupied for five years by Nazi Germany ( 1940 - 45 ) . In 1949 , neutrality was abandoned and Norway became a member of NATO . The company 's chairman and chief executive officer , Robert Miller , told the Associated Press he hopes Delphi can emerge from bankruptcy protection within two years . Discovery of oil and gas in adjacent waters in the late 1960s boosted Norway 's economic fortunes . In referenda held in 1972 and 1994 , Norway rejected joining the EU . Key domestic issues include immigration and integration of ethnic minorities , maintaining the country 's extensive social safety net with an aging population , and preserving economic competitiveness . In 1959 , three years before independence from Belgium , the majority ethnic group , the Hutus , overthrew the ruling Tutsi king . Over the next several years , thousands of Tutsis were killed , and some 1,50,000 driven into exile in neighboring countries . The children of these exiles later formed a rebel group , the Rwandan Patriotic Front ( RPF ) , and began a civil war in 1990 . The war , along with several political and economic upheavals , exacerbated ethnic tensions , culminating in April 1994 in a state-orchestrated genocide , in which Rwandans killed up to a million of their fellow citizens , including approximately three-quarters of the Tutsi population . The genocide ended later that same year when the predominantly Tutsi RPF , operating out of Uganda and northern Rwanda , defeated the national army and Hutu militias , and established an RPF-led government of national unity . Approximately 2 million Hutu refugees - many fearing Tutsi retribution - fled to neighboring Burundi , Tanzania , Uganda , and Zaire . Since then , most of the refugees have returned to Rwanda , but several thousand remained in the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ; the former Zaire ) and formed an extremist insurgency bent on retaking Rwanda , much as the RPF tried in 1990 . The Israeli military began an offensive in Gaza after militants kidnapped an Israeli soldier in June . He said the firm will continue to negotiate with General Motors and its unions to lower labor costs . Rwanda held its first local elections in 1999 and its first post-genocide presidential and legislative elections in 2003 . Rwanda in 2009 staged a joint military operation with the Congolese Army in DRC to rout out the Hutu extremist insurgency there and Kigali and Kinshasa restored diplomatic relations . Rwanda also joined the Commonwealth in late 2009 . Tourism , commerce , and finance are the mainstays of Andorra 's tiny , well-to-do economy , accounting for more than three-quarters of GDP . An estimated 9 million tourists visit annually , attracted by Andorra 's duty-free status for some products and by its summer and winter resorts . Andorra 's comparative advantage eroded when the borders of neighboring France and Spain opened , providing broader availability of goods and lower tariffs . The banking sector also contributes substantially to the economy . Agricultural production is limited - only 2 % of the land is arable - and most food has to be imported . The principal livestock activity is sheep raising . Manufacturing output and exports consist mainly of perfumes and cosmetic products , products of the printing industry , electrical machinery and equipment , clothing , tobacco products , and furniture . Delphi lost nearly $ 5 billion in 2004 and $ 750 million in the first half of this year . Andorra is a member of the EU Customs Union and is treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods ( no tariffs ) and as a non-EU member for agricultural products . A PRINCE had some Monkeys trained to dance . Being naturally great mimics of men 's actions , they showed themselves most apt pupils , and when arrayed in their rich clothes and masks , they danced as well as any of the courtiers . The spectacle was often repeated with great applause , till on one occasion a courtier , bent on mischief , took from his pocket a handful of nuts and threw them upon the stage . The Monkeys at the sight of the nuts forgot their dancing and became ( as indeed they were ) Monkeys instead of actors . Pulling off their masks and tearing their robes , they fought with one another for the nuts . The dancing spectacle thus came to an end amidst the laughter and ridicule of the audience . - \" Not everything you see is what it appears to be . \" A HUNTSMAN , returning with his dogs from the field , fell in by chance with a Fisherman who was bringing home a basket well laden with fish .

But a spokesman for the opposition group said the meeting was intended for experts , not top leaders . The pro-Russian party has been blocking parliamentary proceedings for the past week by barring access to the podium . Party members are dissatisified with the role they have been offered in the new government .

Although explored by the Spanish early in the 16th century , initial attempts at colonizing Costa Rica proved unsuccessful due to a combination of factors , including : disease from mosquito-infested swamps , brutal heat , resistance by natives , and pirate raids . It was not until 1563 that a permanent settlement of Cartago was established in the cooler , fertile central highlands . The area remained a colony for some two and a half centuries . In 1821 , Costa Rica became one of several Central American provinces that jointly declared their independence from Spain . Two years later it joined the United Provinces of Central America , but this federation disintegrated in 1838 , at which time Costa Rica proclaimed its sovereignty and independence .

Hong Kong says it had a record-setting 268 new cases of HIV infection in 2004 . Dr. S. S. Lee , a consultant for the territory 's Health Department , says increased traffic between Hong Kong and China is partly to blame for the rise in HIV cases . China is one of many east Asian nations with a growing AIDS crisis . The step will allow the facility to operate at full capacity . Another militant was killed by U.S. troops in eastern Paktika province . Sri Lankan military officials say at least 18 Tamil rebels and two government soldiers have died in separate clashes .

President Bush has signed legislation reaffirming U.S. support for the continued expansion of NATO . Brazilian officials say air force pilots must follow an eight-step procedure before shooting at a suspected drug plane . Critics say that despite those steps , the chance of human error remains and innocent people could be killed . Such a mistake occurred in Peru in 2001 , and an American missionary and her child were killed . Israel has formally turned over the West Bank city of Jericho to Palestinian forces . Israeli troops took down their national flag and dismantled a key checkpoint as Palestinian forces took up positions inside the city .

Palestinian sources say at least three people described as Israeli collaborators were killed when dozens of masked gunmen stormed a jailhouse and set free several prisoners . Al-Qaida 's deputy leader , Ayman al-Zawahiri , has warned that the Persian Gulf region and Israel will be the terrorist group 's next targets . Germany , France and Lithuania are the latest European countries to congratulate Viktor Yushchenko on his victory in the Ukrainian presidential election . In a letter to Mr. Yushchenko Tuesday , German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder expressed optimism that Ukraine will continue what he called its transition toward the rule of law and a market economy . Lithuanian President Viktor Adamkus congratulated Mr. Yushchenko in a telephone conversation . In Paris , the foreign ministry said France and its European Union partners are determined to support democracy and modernization in Ukraine . Meanwhile , Russia has questioned the objectivity of monitors for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe . That organization characterized last month 's presidential election re-run as flawed , while saying that Sunday 's poll vastly improved upon the last vote . Russia backed Mr. Yushchenko 's opponent . U.S. weather forecasters say Tropical Storm Ernesto has formed over the Caribbean and is heading toward Jamaica and the Cayman Islands . The National Hurricane Center thinks the storm could strengthen in coming days and is on track to enter the Gulf of Mexico next week . The center is urging Jamaica and the Cayman Islands to monitor the threats posed by Ernesto , the fifth named storm of the season . The Egyptian-born Zawahiri issued the threat in a videotaped message that was broadcast Monday - the fifth anniversary of the September 11 attacks on the United States . Earlier Friday , Tropical Storm Debby weakened over the Atlantic . The National Hurricane Center in Miami says Debby is about 2,200 kilometers northwest of the Cape Verde Islands , with winds near 65 kilometers per hour . It says no significant change in strength is expected over the next day . Ethiopian security forces say they have foiled what they describe as a terrorist plot by a group linked to the country 's main opposition party . A statement released through state media says authorities arrested a group that was planning attacks in the capital , Addis Ababa . The statement says the group planned to target government officials and institutions . Ethiopian authorities say they also seized bombs , explosives and small arms related to the plot . The statement did not say how many people were arrested or explain how the alleged group is linked to the opposition Coalition for Unity and Democracy . Leaders of the party were not available for comment . Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi has repeatedly accused the opposition of conspiring to incite violence and seeking to overthrow him . Zawahiri warned of \" new events \" and suggested that militants should target Western economic interests . The government has charged at least 129 opposition leaders , journalists and others with treason and planning to commit genocide . United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has ordered disciplinary action against senior U.N. officials who worked on the oil-for-food program in Iraq . Mr. Annan said in a statement Thursday a report about alleged corruption in the U.N. program has turned up \" extremely troubling evidence of wrongdoing , \" and he pledged that no one involved would be shielded from prosecution . The independent report , released Thursday , concluded that the head of the oil-for-food program , Benon Sevan , seriously undermined the integrity of the United Nations by his conduct . U.N. disciplinary proceedings have begun against Mr. Sevan and another senior official , Joseph Stephanides . Both Mr. Sevan and Mr. Stephanides are Cypriot nationals . Critics say billions of dollars were siphoned away from the oil-for-food program , which was devised after the first Gulf War in an attempt to help Iraq 's impoverished civilian population . Rebels and government forces in Ivory Coast began withdrawing heavy weapons from the front line Thursday , complying with a new peace deal to end tensions in the divided nation . The pullback , expected to last four days , includes all guns larger than 20 millimeters and short-range weaponry equal to or larger than 60 millimeters , including mortars . Anti-tank weapons will remain in place . The deputy-leader also accused Western powers of stealing \" Muslim \" oil . One rebel fighter told VOA he was happy to see the repeatedly postponed disarmament process begin , adding that he hopes to become a police officer once the two-year-old conflict is finally over . Several peace deals have failed to take hold in Ivory Coast . Rebels still hold huge swaths of territory in northern and western Ivory Coast , with the government firmly in control of the south . News reports from Uzbekistan say sporadic gunfire has continued in areas along the Kyrgyz border , following Friday 's military crackdown against protesters in the city of Andijan . The Associated Press quoted residents as saying several soldiers and civilians were killed when clashes erupted Sunday in two border villages , Teshiktosh and Karasu . Earlier reports said as many as 500 people were killed when security forces fired into a crowd of demonstrators in Andijan on Friday . But Uzbek President Islam Karimov said the death toll was much lower . He blamed the bloodshed on Islamic radicals trying to overthrow the government . Several countries , including the United States , have called for restraint . British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw called the Andijan crackdown a clear abuse of human rights . Zawahiri stressed that Western leaders should be more concerned about attacks in the Gulf or Israel than violence in Iraq or Afghanistan . Pope John Paul II has included prayers for the victims of the Asian tsunami in his New Year 's Day Mass marking the Roman Catholic Church 's annual World Day of Peace . Thousands of pilgrims attended the Pope 's outdoor Mass Saturday at the Vatican . John Paul II also led a Mass for the tsunami victims in his private chapel overnight . In his peace message , the pontiff called for greater cooperation among the world 's religions , and for promotion of peace through dialogue , justice and forgiveness . He urged the world 's one billion Roman Catholics to , \" win the fight over evil with the armies of love . \" The European Union opened membership talks with Turkey early Tuesday , after settling last-minute objections by Austria . EU foreign ministers ended 30 hours of heated emergency meetings late Monday in Luxembourg with Austrian officials withdrawing Vienna 's demand that the EU retain the option of offering Turkey a limited partnership . Turkey had rejected the option . Austria 's cooperation paved the way for all 25 EU member-states to agree on a negotiating framework for the membership process , which is expected to take about 10 years . A brief ceremony to officially open the talks took place shortly after midnight Tuesday in Luxembourg . He also made the first indirect threat against United Nations peacekeepers bound for Lebanon . Talks had been scheduled to open Monday . If accepted , Turkey would be the first country with a majority Muslim population to join the European Union . It has been an associate member of the bloc since 1963 . Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has called for both his supporters and opponents to work with him as he embarks on his fifth presidential term . He took the oath of office Tuesday before parliament and several foreign dignitaries , including Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi . In a nationally televised speech , the 77-year-old leader pledged to continue a nascent program of political and economic reforms , and to improve the living standard of Egypt 's majority poor during his term , which runs through 2011 . He also promised November 's legislative elections will be \" free and fair , \" after criticisms that September 's first multi-candidate presidential race was rife with voting irregularities . Mr. Mubarak beat nine challengers , winning more than 88 percent of the vote . Japan says it wants safety guarantees for its players and fans when its national soccer ( football ) team travels to North Korea for a World Cup qualifying match in June . Japan 's Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroyuki Hosoda says it is a necessary precondition for any international match that players can play safely and spectators can be protected . Zawahiri said the force is \" hostile to Islam . \" Japanese concerns were raised by scenes of mob violence at a match in Pyongyang between Iran and North Korea on Wednesday . The game was televised and cameras showed the North Korean spectators throwing bottles , cans and seats at players and officials on the field . Riot police had to clear a path for the victorious Iranian players to reach their team bus . The violence at the game was a rare occurrence in the tightly controlled North Korean state . A published report says the United States has been flying drones over Iran for almost a year , looking for evidence of nuclear weapons programs and detect weaknesses in air defenses . In Sunday 's editions , The Washington Post quotes three U.S. officials as saying the U.S. military has been launching the unmanned surveillance flights from Iraq . There has been no U.S. comment on the report . An Iranian spokesman Sunday again warned the United States not to attack its nuclear facilities . He also rejected a European proposal aimed at restricting Tehran 's development of nuclear fuel . Iran has said in the past it would stop plans to build a heavy water nuclear reactor , which can be used to make nuclear weapons-grade material as well as for nuclear energy . The message was not dated , but Zawahiri referred to the war between Israel and Hezbollah guerrillas . But Sunday in Tehran , a foreign ministry spokesman said Iran will go forward with the heavy water reactor and will not replace it under any circumstances . North Korea says its Catholic community has organized religious services in memory of Pope John Paul . The official news agency , KCNA , on Tuesday quotes Samuel Jang Jae On , described as head of the country 's Catholic association , as saying North Korean Catholics are deeply saddened by the pontiff 's passing . The agency says Mr. Jang sent the Vatican a message of condolence . North Korea is widely described as one of the world 's most repressive political regimes . It is not clear how many Catholics live in the Communist nation and to what extent they can practice their religion . Thousands of protesters have demonstrated outside a Philippine army camp , where U.S. soldiers and Philippine troops have begun joint military exercises . Demonstrators in the town of Carmen on the southern island of Mindanao chanted anti-U.S. slogans Tuesday and demanded that American troops leave the area . U.S. soldiers will also take part in the Philippines ' annual war games , to be held next month on Jolo island in the southern Philippines . Jolo is where the al-Qaida-linked militant group Abu Sayyaf has carried out bombings , kidnappings and killings of foreigners in recent years . An animal rights group says more than 40 dolphins are being held under what it calls \" appalling \" conditions in the Solomon Islands . Philippine law prohibits American troops from joining any combat operations with Philippine forces . Security for the war games will be tight , to protect the soldiers from attacks by rebels . In addition to military training , troops will carry out humanitarian missions to try to boost support among Jolo 's residents . The U.N. World Food Program is giving emergency assistance to the Cuban government . The WFP announced Tuesday that it will help feed about two million people at a cost of nearly $ 6 million . The aid package is intended to help Cuba recover from last month 's devastation from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike . During the next six months , WFP will provide food rations , including rice , beans , vegetable oil , canned fish and more . The WFP will also supply temporary food storage warehouses and liquid gas stoves to people who lost their cooking facilities in the storms . Sweden 's Nobel Foundation begins announcing winners of the annual Nobel Prize awards on Monday in Oslo , Norway . Prizes for medicine , physics , chemistry and literature will be announced before the prestigious Peace Prize is revealed Friday . It was not immediately clear what motivated the attack . The World Society for the Protection of Animals says the dolphins are being kept in cages in overcrowded , shallow and polluted pens off the island of Gavutu in the Pacific island nation . A separate prize for economics will be announced October 10 . It was instituted in 1968 by the Bank of Sweden in memory of the founder of the Nobel Prize , Swedish philanthropist Alfred Nobel . Winners receive their awards , including a check worth $ 1.3 million , at a banquet on December 10 . That is the anniversary of Mr. Nobel 's death in 1896 . According to his will , a five-member committee elected by the Norwegian parliament chooses the Peace Prize laureate , while Swedish scientific and literary groups choose the other winners . The first Nobel Prizes were given in 1901 . Insurgents in Iraq fired a barrage of mortar rounds into central Baghdad Thursday , killing at least one person and wounding several others . Police say some of the mortars landed in the Green Zone -- the heavily fortified enclave that houses Iraqi government offices and several foreign embassies . Last week , a mortar attack on the Green Zone killed four employees of a British security company . The group says the dolphins suffer from cuts , scratches and sunburn , and appear to be undernourished and stressed . Meanwhile , the U.S. military is planning to temporarily increase the number of American troops in Iraq to bolster security ahead of Iraq 's January election . The Defense Department said Wednesday the size of U.S. forces in Iraq will increase to 1,50,000 from its current level of 1,38,000 . Iraq 's interim government has rejected calls from some Sunni parties to postpone the vote because of security concerns . Brazilian lawmakers have approved legislation that will give the government more control over developing offshore oil fields . The lower house of the Brazilian congress passed the bill Wednesday , sending it to outgoing President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva for his signature . The measure allows the state-owned oil company , known as Petrobras , to be the sole operator of unexplored offshore oil fields , as well as a 30 percent stake in any joint ventures . Brazil has discovered potentially large oil reserves off the country 's southeastern coast , some of them thousands of meters below the sea floor . Some estimates say the fields may contain more than 50 billion barrels of oil . Brazilian lawmakers also approved a provision that will allow non-oil producing states to receive more oil revenues . A new U.S. opinion survey shows eight out of 10 Americans believe the country is going in the wrong direction . The group urged the Solomon Islands to rehabilitate and release the dolphins into the wild . The Washington Post-ABC News poll also indicates Democrats hold a 21 percentage point advantage over Republicans as the party better equipped to handle the country 's problems . In a hypothetical general election match-up , Democratic Party candidate Senator Barack Obama leads presumed Republican nominee John McCain by 51-to-44 percent . As the Democratic Party nears the end of its presidential primaries , the national poll shows Obama has a 12-point advantage over Senator Hillary Clinton as the party 's choice for its nomination . The poll says Americans cite the economy and employment as their top voting issue , followed by the Iraq war , healthcare and fuel prices . The poll of more than 1,100 adults , conducted from May 8 - 11 , has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points . Cuban President Raul Castro is visiting Venezuela on his first international trip as leader of the communist nation . Venezuela 's socialist president , Hugo Chavez , welcomed Mr. Castro Saturday at the Caracas airport . This is President Castro 's first official foreign trip since February , when the 77-year-old took charge from his ailing older brother , Fidel Castro . The two leaders will visit the tomb of South American independence icon Simon Bolivar today and later hold talks on a variety of issues . Venezuela and Cuba have increased cooperation on energy and oil production . Last year , 28 dolphins were transported by plane from the Solomon Islands to Mexico , sparking international criticism . Venezuela is a critical trade partner for the Caribbean island nation , which imports nearly 1,00,000 barrels of oil per day from Venezuela . Today 's visit comes ahead of a summit in Brazil next week , where Latin American and Caribbean leaders will gather for talks . The nuclear cooperation pact between India and the United States has sparked a mixed reaction in Washington and abroad . International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Mohamed ElBaradei praised the agreement , saying it would bring India closer as an important partner in the non-proliferation group of countries . But some U.S. lawmakers criticized the deal , saying the agreement that could give India access to U.S. civilian nuclear technology would undermine the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . India has not signed the treaty , which restricts the sharing of some nuclear technology with non-member nations , and drew widespread international criticism for conducting nuclear weapons tests as recently as 1998 . Full details of the nuclear cooperation pact have not been released , but the agreement must still be approved by Congress before taking effect . President Bush acknowledged Thursday that hard work still needs to be done to gain the necessary approval in Congress . A Sudanese analyst says the late rebel leader John Garang was a symbol of the struggle for greater federalism in the country . Lecturer John Gai Yoh of the University of South Africa ( UNISA ) in Pretoria credits the leader of the Sudanese Liberation Movement with creating a campaign that included allies beyond his base in the south . A reporters ' advocacy group has condemned the shutdown of a Somali radio station and the detention of two of its reporters . Mr. Yoh notes that his vision materialized with the comprehensive peace agreement signed last January between the former SPLA rebels and the government in Khartoum . Analyst John Gai Yoh predicts that the SPLA will continue to democratize : it has created a new SPLA parliament for the south and has named a new five-man military panel to lead the movement . The United Nations has given its annual Franklin Delano Roosevelt International Disability Award to Poland , recognizing the country 's efforts to integrate the disabled into Polish society . President Lech Kaczynski accepted the award at a ceremony Monday at U.N. headquarters in New York . He said his country 's struggle for freedom includes a commitment to the rights of those with disabilities . He said their rights are guaranteed by the Polish constitution . Mr. Kaczynski promised that Poland will adopt a new U.N. convention to protect the disabled . The award is named for U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt , whose legs were paralyzed from polio . Mr. Roosevelt was president from 1933 until 1945 . An Ethiopian government spokesman denies that a reported rebel attack said to have killed 140 soldiers ever took place . The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists says it is alarmed by the closure of Radio Shabelle in the city of Baidoa on Sunday . The spokesman , Zemedkun Tekle , issued the denial Sunday after media reports said the Ogaden National Liberation Front had claimed to have carried out the deadly attack Saturday in southeastern Ethiopia near Wardheer . A purported statement from the group received by some news organizations said about a thousand rebels took part in the attack and seized ammunition along with military hardware . The government spokesman says there was no attack , and that the rebel group is not in a position to carry out such an attack . Rebels have been fighting for more autonomy for ethnic Somalis in the eastern region of Ogaden bordering Somalia . Kuwaiti television reports the kidnappers in Iraq of American journalist Jill Carroll are threatening to kill her if their demands are not met by February 26 . Al-Rai television Friday quoted sources close to the kidnappers as saying the abductors have set the deadline . The militants holding Carroll previously had demanded that all Iraqi women prisoners be freed . Earlier Friday , at least eight people died and more than 20 were wounded in a Baghdad car bombing near a Sunni Muslim mosque . Officials in Iraq also certified results of the December 15 elections , confirming the near majority of parliament seats won by Shi'ite religious parties . According to the results , the dominant Shi'ite coalition , the United Iraqi Alliance , won 128 seats in the 275-member parliament . Somalia 's transitional government shut down the station after it broadcast a report saying 300 Ethiopian soldiers had crossed into Somalia . Palestinian security officials say masked Palestinian police briefly stormed a government building in the Gaza Strip in anger over not receiving their salaries from the Hamas-led government . Security officials say about 50 police officers sealed off the main road Saturday in the central Gaza town of Khan Younis . They say the masked police surrounded a municipal government building , taking positions on the roof and firing in the air . The protest is seen as a sign of discontent with the new Hamas-led government , which took office late last month . The cash-strapped Palestinian Authority has not been able to pay salaries to some 1,40,000 government employees since March . Western nations have cut off aid to the Palestinian government , demanding that Hamas renounce violence and recognize Israel . The White House said President Bush has approved duty-free treatment for imports of certain types of watches that are n't produced in \" significant quantities \" in the U.S. , the Virgin Islands and other U.S. possessions . The action came in response to a petition filed by Timex Inc. for changes in the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences for imports from developing nations . Previously , watch imports were denied such duty-free treatment . Timex had requested duty-free treatment for many types of watches , covered by 58 different U.S. tariff classifications . Ethiopia has denied the report . The White House said Mr. Bush decided to grant duty-free status for 18 categories , but turned down such treatment for other types of watches \" because of the potential for material injury to watch producers located in the U.S. and the Virgin Islands . \" Timex is a major U.S. producer and seller of watches , including low-priced battery-operated watches assembled in the Philippines and other developing nations covered by the U.S. tariff preferences . U.S. trade officials said the Philippines and Thailand would be the main beneficiaries of the president 's action . Imports of the types of watches that now will be eligible for duty-free treatment totaled about $ 37.3 million in 1988 , a relatively small share of the $ 1.5 billion in U.S. watch imports that year , according to an aide to U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills . Although known to Arab and Malay sailors as early as the 10th century , Mauritius was first explored by the Portuguese in the 16th century and subsequently settled by the Dutch - who named it in honor of Prince Maurits van NASSAU - in the 17th century . The French assumed control in 1715 , developing the island into an important naval base overseeing Indian Ocean trade , and establishing a plantation economy of sugar cane . The British captured the island in 1810 , during the Napoleonic Wars . Mauritius remained a strategically important British naval base , and later an air station , playing an important role during World War II for anti-submarine and convoy operations , as well as the collection of signals intelligence . Independence from the UK was attained in 1968 . A stable democracy with regular free elections and a positive human rights record , the country has attracted considerable foreign investment and has earned one of Africa 's highest per capita incomes . The advocacy group quotes Radio Shabelle 's deputy director Mohamed Amiin as saying militiamen entered its premises and detained the two journalists , Mohamed Adawe and Ali Mohamed Saed , for about eight hours . Recent poor weather , declining sugar prices , and declining textile and apparel production , have slowed economic growth , leading to some protests over standards of living in the Creole community . Morocco 's market economy benefits from the country 's relatively low labor costs and proximity to Europe , which aid key areas of the economy such as agriculture , light manufacturing , tourism , and remittances . Morocco is also the world 's largest exporter of phosphate , which has long provided a source of export earnings and economic stability . Economic policies pursued since 2003 by King MOHAMMED VI have brought macroeconomic stability to the country with generally low inflation , improved financial performance , and steady progress in developing the service and industrial sectors . In 2006 , Morocco entered a Free Trade Agreement ( FTA ) with the US , and in 2008 entered into an advanced status in its 2000 Association Agreement with the EU . However , poverty , illiteracy , and unemployment rates remain high . In response to these challenges , King MOHAMMED in 2005 launched a National Initiative for Human Development , a $ 2 billion program aimed at alleviating poverty and underdevelopment by expanding electricity to rural areas and replacing urban slums with public and subsidized housing , among other policies . Morocco 's trade and budget deficits widened in 2010 , and reducing government spending and adapting to sluggish economic growth in Europe will be challenges in 2011 . Morocco 's long-term challenges include improving education and job prospects for young Moroccans , closing the disparity in wealth between the rich and the poor , confronting corruption , and expanding and diversifying exports beyond phosphates and low-value-added products . Albania , a formerly closed , centrally-planned state , is making the difficult transition to a more modern open-market economy . It says the government gave no explanation for its action . Macroeconomic growth averaged around 6 % between 2004 - 8 , but declined to about 3 % in 2009 - 10 . Inflation is low and stable . The government has taken measures to curb violent crime , and recently adopted a fiscal reform package aimed at reducing the large gray economy and attracting foreign investment . Remittances , a significant catalyst for economic growth have declined from Dec-15 % of GDP to 9 % of GDP in 2009 , mostly from Albanians residing in Greece and Italy ; this helps offset the towering trade deficit . The agricultural sector , which accounts for almost half of employment but only about one-fifth of GDP , is limited primarily to small family operations and subsistence farming because of lack of modern equipment , unclear property rights , and the prevalence of small , inefficient plots of land . Energy shortages because of a reliance on hydropower , and antiquated and inadequate infrastructure contribute to Albania 's poor business environment and lack of success in attracting new foreign investment needed to expand the country 's export base . FDI is among the lowest in the region , but the government has embarked on an ambitious program to improve the business climate through fiscal and legislative reforms . The completion of a new thermal power plant near Vlore has helped diversify generation capacity , and plans to upgrade transmission lines between Albania and Montenegro and Kosovo would help relieve the energy shortages . Also , with help from EU funds , the government is taking steps to improve the poor national road and rail network , a long-standing barrier to sustained economic growth . Economic activity consists primarily of subsistence farming and fishing . Taleban rebels are not known to operate in northern Afghanistan and the area has been spared much of the bloodshed that has plagued southern and eastern regions . The station remained off the air on Monday . The islands have few mineral deposits worth exploiting , except for high-grade phosphate . The potential for a tourist industry exists , but the remote location , a lack of adequate facilities , and limited air connections hinder development . Under the original terms of the Compact of Free Association , the US provided $ 1.3 billion in grant aid during the period 1986 - 2001 ; the level of aid has been subsequently reduced . The Amended Compact of Free Association with the US guarantees the Federated States of Micronesia ( FSM ) millions of dollars in annual aid through 2023 , and establishes a Trust Fund into which the US and the FSM make annual contributions in order to provide annual payouts to the FSM in perpetuity after 2023 . The country 's medium-term economic outlook appears fragile due not only to the reduction in US assistance but also to the current slow growth of the private sector . The discovery and exploitation of large oil and gas reserves have contributed to dramatic economic growth but fluctuating oil prices have produced huge swings in GDP growth in recent years . Forestry and farming are also minor components of GDP . Subsistence farming is the dominate form of livelihood . Although pre-independence Equatorial Guinea counted on cocoa production for hard currency earnings , the neglect of the rural economy under successive regimes has diminished potential for agriculture-led growth ( the government has stated its intention to reinvest some oil revenue into agriculture ) . A number of aid programs sponsored by the World Bank and the IMF have been cut off since 1993 because of corruption and mismanagement . Deputy Director Amiin says the station stands by its report that Ethiopian troops took up positions at Baidoa 's airport on Saturday . The government has been widely criticized for its lack of transparency and misuse of oil revenues ; however , in 2010 , under Equatorial Guinea 's candidacy in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative , the government published oil revenue figures for the first time . Undeveloped natural resources include gold , zinc , diamonds , columbite-tantalite , and other base metals . Growth remained strong in 2008 , when oil production peaked , but slowed in 2009 - 10 , as the price of oil and the production level fell . A BOSS who had gone to Canada was taunted by a Citizen of Montreal with having fled to avoid prosecution . \" You do me a grave injustice , \" said the Boss , parting with a pair of tears . \" I came to Canada solely because of its political attractions ; its Government is the most corrupt in the world . \" \" Pray forgive me , \" said the Citizen of Montreal . They fell upon each other 's neck , and at the conclusion of that touching rite the Boss had two watches . There are less than three months until the election , an election that will decide the next President of the United States . The man elected will be the president of all Americans , not just the Democrats or the Republicans . The U.S. military says the trials of three Army reservists charged with abusing detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison will be moved to the United States . To show our solidarity as Americans , let 's all get together and show each other our support for the candidate of our choice . It 's time that we all came together , Democrats and Republicans alike . If you support the policies and character of President George W. Bush , please drive with your headlights on during the day . If you support John Kerry , please drive with your headlights off at night . A topologist is a person who does n't know the difference between a coffee cup and a doughnut . Lawyers get a lot of unjust criticism . I would remind you that it is not right to condemn a whole profession just because of 3,50,000 bad apples . I was very lonely when I was a child . I only had two imaginary friends ... And they would only play with each other . In a statement released late Wednesday , officials say the courts martial of Specialist Charles Graner , Sergeant Javal Davis , and Specialist Sabrina Harman would be held early next year in Fort Hood , Texas instead of Baghdad . The Russian and European space agencies have announced a deal to build a manned spacecraft for near-earth orbits and trips to the moon . Russian news agency reports quote a spokesman for the Russian agency Roskosmos as saying engineers want to test a 20-ton capsule by 2015 . A first launch is planned for 2018 at a launch center in Siberia . Under the pact , Russia will build the capsule , while European engineers build the service module and the engine block . The new craft is to be phased in as the replacement for Russia 's Soyuz spacecraft , which has come under increased scrutiny this year , after two consecutive rough landings on return from the International Space Station . A human-rights group in Niger says the government is to blame for cancellation of a ceremony that was to grant 7,000 slaves their freedom . The group Timidria had planned to release the slaves in the Ates region near Niger 's western border with Mali on Saturday , but the event was called off when none of the slaves showed up . The rights group says the government intimidated slaves to keep them from attending the ceremony - a charge the government denies . Niger officially banned slavery in 2003 , but human-rights groups say 43,000 people are still in bondage in the West African nation . They are among the 2,00,000 people enslaved along centuries-old Arab-African Saharan trade routes . No reason for the change of venue was given . Generations of Africans have been born in slavery , many under the ownership of one family . Embattled Ivory Coast President Laurent Gbagbo has said he wants to talk with his rival , Alassane Ouattara . Mr. Gbagbo has been isolated by the international community , including the United States , after refusing to yield the presidency although he had fewer votes than Mr. Ouattara in last month 's poll . Both men have taken the oath of office and begun organizing competing governments . Earlier this week , the African Union dispatched former South African president Thabo Mbeki to seek a solution , but after two days of talks , the situation was not resolved . The Ivory Coast 's presidential election , its first in 10 years , was meant to restore stability to the West African country , which was split into rebel- and government-controlled areas during a 2002 civil war . Officials in Afghanistan say a suicide bomber has killed four Afghan employees of a U.S.-owned private security firm and wounded one other in southern Kandahar province . Authorities said Sunday the bomber rode a motorbike next to a vehicle owned by the company , U.S. Protection and Investigations , and detonated his explosives . Three guards and the vehicle 's driver were killed , and another guard was wounded . On Saturday , a suicide bomber killed seven police officers and a civilian in eastern Afghanistan 's Khost province , near the Pakistan border . Three other U.S. troops have pleaded guilty in connection with prisoner abuse at the Baghdad prison . The Taleban is reported to have taken responsibility for the blast . NATO forces in Afghanistan are preparing for another upsurge in violence this year , having already launched an operation in the south to preempt an anticipated offensive by Taleban fighters . Turkish police have detained more than 80 people and used tear gas to prevent thousands of leftist protesters from marching to Istanbul 's Taksim square to hold a May Day rally . Authorities declared the square off-limits to protesters , but allowed a small number of trade union leaders to lay flowers at the square to mark the day . Officials had shut down schools in the area for the day for fear of violence . Members of leftist groups often clash with police during May Day observances in Turkey . In 1977 , a May Day rally at Taksim square turned violent when unidentified gunmen opened fire on a crowd of demonstrators . Thirty-seven people were killed in that incident . The race for Iraq 's new prime minister narrowed Tuesday , when one of two top Shi'ite parties withdrew its candidate from consideration . Interim Finance Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi , who had been the candidate of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq , withdrew his name from contention . Most of those charged were part of a military police company based in the U.S. state of Maryland . This leaves the head of the Islamic Dawa Party , Ibrahim al-Jaafari , as the likely front-runner . Both parties belong to the United Iraqi Alliance , which won about 48 percent of the vote for the National Assembly . Meanwhile , Iraq 's Electoral Commission says it has received at least three complaints from political groups challenging the election results . A final , certified vote tally is expected Wednesday . And Turkish shipping magnate Kahraman Sadikoglu , who was abducted in southern Iraq in December , has been freed after reports said his family paid a ransom to his kidnappers . A Council of Europe panel says Turkey has passed important legislation protecting minority rights , but has not adequately enforced the new laws . In a report , the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance says that despite the new legislation , Turkey 's constitution and its civil , criminal and administrative laws continue to have gaps in addressing racism . The report , issued Tuesday in Strasbourg , says Kurds and other minorities still face adversity in Turkey , particularly from ongoing violence in the southeast where Kurdish separatists have been active in recent decades . Turkey 's move to push through legal and economic reforms is considered an essential part of its bid to join the European Union . The Council of Europe is a 46-nation group that brings together lawmakers from democratic European countries to review major issues facing the continent . The prisoner abuse scandal erupted in April when photographs of U.S. soldiers taunting and humiliating naked Iraqi prisoners became public , sparking worldwide condemnation .

Oil refineries , drilling platforms and pipelines largely escaped damage from Hurricane Rita , sending prices down to about $ 64 a barrel in Monday morning trading . The falling prices were unlike the dramatic spike that followed Hurricane Katrina , but that has not eased worries among industry analysts and politicians about the tight oil supply . But he added that its production was diminishing due to the growth of the regular economy , including the cultivation of other crops . Nearly all the major refineries along the Gulf of Mexico were shut down before or during Hurricane Rita , cutting total U.S. oil production by nearly 30 percent . With little excess refining capacity , analysts say oil prices remain vulnerable to even minor disruptions in the global supply . The U.S. Energy Department Monday will brief President Bush on damage to Gulf oil facilities and the status of the nation 's energy industry .

Washington says it wants to build missile defense sites in Poland and the Czech Republic to counter a possible threat by North Korean and Iranian long-range missiles . Russia has also called the plans a mistake and has noted that neither North Korea nor Iran have such missiles . The Pentagon has acknowledged that Iran does not currently possess long-range missiles , but says it is important to stay one step ahead . The African Union has extended the mandate for its Darfur peacekeeping mission until the end of the year as it waits to assemble a combined force with the United Nations .

Former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell has criticized the Hurricane Katrina relief effort . In a taped ABC television interview to air late Friday , Mr. Powell expressed his opinion that \" there have been a lot of failures at a lot of levels - [ of ] local , state and federal [ government ] . \" The former top U.S. diplomat said \" there was more than enough warning over time about the dangers to New Orleans , \" but not enough was done . Mr. Powell , who was the highest ranking black official during President Bush 's first term , says he does not believe race was a factor in the slow response to the hurricane . Mr. Powell says many of those unable to evacuate New Orleans before Katrina struck were trapped by poverty , which disproportionately affects blacks . New studies by British and French researchers show quick treatment for minor strokes can dramatically cut the risk of major strokes later . The research , published in the journals Lancetand Lancet Neurology , found that patients treated within 24 hours for so-called mini-strokes cut the later risk of a major stroke by about 80 percent . He also described faith as a means of counteracting violence and a way of bringing attention to such problems as poverty and hunger in the world . Oxford researcher Peter Rothwell says the vast majority of British stroke patients wait several weeks before reporting mini-stroke symptoms to health care professionals . The second study by French researchers also found that the early , aggressive treatment of mini-strokes brought similar benefits . Strokes occur when blood flow to the brain is blocked . Such events kill brain tissue and are one of the leading causes of death or permanent disability worldwide . Symptoms include facial numbness , slurred speech , partial paralysis and sudden headaches . Treatments include blood thinning drugs and anti-cholesterol medications . Crude oil prices fell Wednesday after a U.S. government report showed an increase in inventories , reflecting decreased demand . The price of a barrel of oil for future delivery fell 35 cents [ about one percent ] to $ 38.68 a barrel during trading in New York . The fall in prices followed a U.S. Energy Department report showing crude oil supplies in the U.S. rose last week by 5,49,000 barrels , or about two-tenths of one percent . Iraqi police say a U.S. airstrike on a home in northern Iraq late Monday killed a number of people from the same family , but there are conflicting reports about the incident .

The French News Agency quotes Lebanon 's Justice Minister as saying traces of explosives were found on their aircraft 's seats . Oil prices went as high as $ 103.05 a barrel in Friday 's trading - the highest price ever recorded - before easing slightly . It is the latest in a string of record-highs set in recent days as a weakening U.S. dollar and the threat of inflation makes tangible assets like oil and other commodities more attractive to investors . Speculators interpreted recent comments by the head of the U.S. central bank Ben Bernanke as pointing to further interest rate cuts . Interest rate reductions are intended to boost U.S. economic growth , but can also further weaken the dollar .

He said he strongly disagrees with the publication of the cartoons , considered blasphemous by Muslims , and has no objection to the Muslim protests if they are peaceful . Earlier reports said Mr. Latortue was sending a representative to talk with Mr. Aristide and South African President Thabo Mbeki . Mr. Aristide has been living in exile in South Africa since he was forced from power last February . The reports said the envoy would try to convince Mr. Aristide to persuade his followers to stop fighting his foes and help stabilize Haiti before elections planned this year . More than 200 people have died in the violence since September . United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has warned governments around the world not to ignore international agreements prohibiting torture . In a statement issued for International Human Rights Day Saturday , Mr. Annan said there has been a disturbing trend of nations claiming exceptions to prohibitions on torture , based on their own national security perceptions . The U.N. chief said torture can never be a tool to fight terror , but rather is an instrument of terror . In a separate statement , 33 U.N. human rights experts expressed alarm at attempts by many countries to circumvent international human rights laws by giving new names to practices such as torture . The experts called on governments to respect human rights standards and to not ignore them when they become , in the statement 's wording , \" inconvenient . \" Meteorologists say the storm known as Rita has strengthened into a category 1 hurricane . But he said by holding violent demonstrations that have killed 18 people , Muslims have missed an opportunity to build better ties with the West . The U.S. National Hurricane Center says Rita is packing winds of about 120 kilometers per hour as it moves west , past the Bahamas and toward the Florida Keys . The storm reportedly caused little damage in the Bahamas . However , thousands of tourists and residents have fled the Keys , a low-lying chain of islands off Florida 's southern coast .

Hassan Rohani told reporters Tuesday in Tehran that Iran will only suspend uranium enrichment for the length of international negotiations on the country 's nuclear program , which he says should take months , not years . A U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Monday the world must \" remain vigilant \" about Iran 's nuclear ambitions . He said if Iran fails to uphold the terms of Monday 's European-brokered resolution , the International Atomic Energy Agency should immediately refer Tehran to the U.N. Security Council for the possible imposition of sanctions . Washington has accused Tehran of violating the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty with a secret nuclear weapons development program . Iran has repeatedly denied the charges . Russian police confirm that a shrapnel-packed bomb exploded Sunday in a McDonald 's restaurant in St. Petersburg , injuring six people . The blast shattered windows and caused the ceiling to collapse . None of the injuries was serious .

A military spokesman Monday said U.S. forces tracked the drone in Iraqi airspace for one hour and ten minutes before shooting it down , about 100 kilometers north of Baghdad . The spokesman added that \" this was not an accident on the part of the Iranians . \" The incident was first reported by Wired.com earlier this month but , at the time , the U.S. military declined comment . Washington has previously accused Iran of meddling in the affairs of neighboring Iraq , where the U.S. has had troops since it invaded the country in 2003 . The Palestinian militant group Hamas Thursday banned men from working in hair salons or beauty parlors that cater to women , part of a campaign to enforce a stricter interpretation of Muslim law . Hamas officials said any man who continues to cut women 's hair will be arrested and tried in court . A foreign ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi told reporters Sunday in Tehran that International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors would only take samples from so-called \" green areas \" at the military site , and not from inside the installation . Islamic extremists in Gaza have been waging a campaign against cafes and shops that sell or play music deemed unsuitable , as well as against Christian institutions . They have called on Hamas to impose a more fundamentalist brand of Islam . One hairdresser who is impacted by the ban - Barakat al-Ghoul - told the Associated Press he fears he will no longer be able to make a living . Al-Ghoul said he had been cutting women 's hair for 26 years . He insisted he did not violate Islamic law because he only cuts hair and does not do makeup . The head of the U.N. nulcear agency says Iran has agreed to allow inspectors access to a military site that the United States alleges is linked to a secret nuclear weapons program .

The report says the officials discussed new evidence that Pyongyang may have sold to Libya a form of uranium used in nuclear weapons . The IAEA has been seeking access to Parchin , which has long been used by Iran to research , develop and produce missiles and other high explosives . The Times quotes Asian officials who say China has promised to send a delegation to North Korea . But the officials say China also advised President Bush against making the kind of public statements about the North Korean situation as he did about Iraq 's alleged threat before the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 . Iran 's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has ordered state-run broadcasters to stop playing Western and so-called \" indecent \" music . Iranian media reported Monday that he asked the agency in charge of television and radio broadcasts , the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting , to implement the change within six months . Mr. Ahmadinejad also called for the government to supervise the content of foreign-made television shows and films . Mr. Ahmadinejad was elected earlier this year on a hard-line platform that called for a return to conservative principles .

United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan is calling on NATO and the European Union to do more to help end violence in Sudan 's Darfur region . Speaking at the Munich Security Conference , Mr. Annan said NATO and the EU have the capacity to protect the people who are dying every day in western Sudan . He said more international forces are needed to help stop fighting and to provide for secure humanitarian operations . Mr. Annan says an African Union mission of about 3,000 troops and observers in the region can not do the job alone . Earlier this month , a U.N. panel found that civilians in Darfur have been brutalized in a campaign that may amount to crimes against humanity . Sudanese troops and pro-government forces have been fighting rebels , who launched an uprising two years ago . Local media say the militants , thought to be members of a group ( the Islamic Jihad League ) tied to al-Qaida , were planning attacks against U.S. , Israeli and NATO targets in Turkey . A leading international human rights group says it is \" deeply concerned \" for the safety of Iranian Nobel Laureate Shirin Ebadi , who has refused an order to appear before Iran 's hard-line Revolutionary Court . Human Rights Watch called the court summons a \" blatant attempt \" by Iran 's government to \" silence one of the few remaining voices of human rights \" in the Islamic Republic . In Tehran Sunday , a Foreign Ministry spokesman said the human rights lawyer was the subject of a private complaint . However , Ms. Ebadi , in comments to Reuters news agency , cast doubt on the use of the Revolutionary Court for such complaints , noting that the tribunal handles national security matters . Saturday , Ms. Ebadi said she would not honor the court summons , because it failed to state the charges against her . Failure to appear could land her in prison .

Fort McPherson in Georgia was one of the approved closures . In May , the Pentagon recommended the closure of military installations from Maine to Hawaii . They say the suspects may have had contact with al-Qaida 's second-in-command , Ayman al-Zawahri , and may have been trained in Afghanistan . Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said the plan would save $ 49 billion over 20 years and make it easier to deploy forces quickly . President Bush must certify a final list of base closures recommended by the commission and submit the list to Congress for approval .

He said it involved seven people and that three of them have been expelled from Italy , two are under arrest , one is under surveillance , and another is still at large . Pisanu said the group planned to attack the San Petronio basilica in Bologna . A Moscow court has rejected the appeal of former Russian oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky against his conviction on fraud and tax evasion charges , but the court reduced his prison sentence from nine to eight years . It features a fresco that Muslim groups have said is insulting to the Prophet Muhammad . Pisanu 's remarks come as Italians are preparing for national elections on Sunday and Monday . Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his administration to study foreign and domestic criticism of a bill to strictly regulate non-governmental organizations . Mr. Putin offered no specific suggestions , but ordered submission of amendments to the controversial bill within five days . As presently written , the bill would subject Russian branches of foreign organizations to various restrictions and to the oversight of Russian authorities . Human rights groups have condemned the measure , calling it a reflection of the Kremlin 's crackdown on civil society institutions . President Putin said Monday that such a bill is necessary to combat the threats of terrorism and what he called \" misanthropic ideologies . \" But , he said , a civil society is crucial , and Russia can not afford to curtail that development . A Netherlands court has opened a pretrial hearing in the case of a Dutch businessman charged with complicity in genocide by selling chemical weapons ingredients to ousted Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein . Frans van Anraat appeared Friday in a Rotterdam courtroom . Khodorkovsky , once Russia 's richest man , was convicted in May in what his supporters call a political trial in retaliation for the tycoon 's backing of opposition politicians . The 62-year-old defendant is accused of exporting tons of chemicals that Iraq used to make weapons over a four-year period beginning in 1984 . Prosecutors say Saddam used the weapons in the 1988 attack on the Kurdish town of Halabja that killed 5,000 people . Some survivors of the attack attended Friday 's hearing . A prosecutor told the court Mr. van Anraat continued to sell Iraq chemicals even after the Halabja attack . But the defendant denies any wrongdoing . Mr. van Anraat fled to Iraq in 1989 .

Mr. Bowen 's report , released Thursday , describes how tens of millions of dollars were dispersed for Iraq construction projects with little or no documentation during 2003 and 2004 . The report says that while incompetence or haste may account for some problems , there are indications of fraud . The force is monitoring a cease-fire between Darfur rebels and pro-government Arab militia . The inspector general notes the money in question was not U.S. taxpayer dollars but rather Iraqi money designated for reconstruction projects . U.S. officials responding to the report have attributed the accounting problems to the difficulties of working in a war-time environment .

The Israeli army says its soldiers patrolling the border with Egypt have mistakenly shot and wounded an Egyptian security officer . China says at least 37 miners died early Sunday in a coal mine accident in the central province of Henan . A military spokeswoman Monday said Israeli troops on patrol outside the city of Eilat saw what they considered a suspicious , armed person at the border . She said the troops fired at the man after he cocked his weapon . The Israeli army says the soldiers only then realized the man , who was wounded in the chest , was an Egyptian security officer . A joint Israeli-Egyptian team is investigating the incident . Shootings between Israeli and Egyptian forces along the border region have been rare since the two countries signed a peace treaty in 1979 . Two British lawmakers have called for an inquiry into claims that a British-based security firm operating in Iraq withheld intelligence from British troops .

Magna said Mr. McAlpine resigned to pursue a consulting career , with Magna as one of his clients . Resistance by native Caribs prevented colonization on Saint Vincent until 1719 . Disputed between France and the United Kingdom for most of the 18th century , the island was ceded to the latter in 1783 . Between 1960 and 1962 , Saint Vincent and the Grenadines was a separate administrative unit of the Federation of the West Indies . Autonomy was granted in 1969 and independence in 1979 . The Slovene lands were part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until the latter 's dissolution at the end of World War I . In 1918 , the Slovenes joined the Serbs and Croats in forming a new multinational state , which was named Yugoslavia in 1929 . After World War II , Slovenia became a republic of the renewed Yugoslavia , which though Communist , distanced itself from Moscow 's rule . Dissatisfied with the exercise of power by the majority Serbs , the Slovenes succeeded in establishing their independence in 1991 after a short 10-day war . The accident happened one day after a fire at a coal mine in northeastern China killed at least five miners and trapped 30 . Historical ties to Western Europe , a strong economy , and a stable democracy have assisted in Slovenia 's transformation to a modern state . Slovenia acceded to both NATO and the EU in the spring of 2004 ; it joined the eurozone in 2007 . The use of the name Montenegro began in the 15th century when the Crnojevic dynasty began to rule the Serbian principality of Zeta ; over subsequent centuries Montenegro was able to maintain its independence from the Ottoman Empire . From the 16th to 19th centuries , Montenegro became a theocracy ruled by a series of bishop princes ; in 1852 , it was transformed into a secular principality . After World War I , Montenegro was absorbed by the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats , and Slovenes , which became the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929 ; at the conclusion of World War II , it became a constituent republic of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia . When the latter dissolved in 1992 , Montenegro federated with Serbia , first as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and , after 2003 , in a looser union of Serbia and Montenegro . In May 2006 , Montenegro invoked its right under the Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro to hold a referendum on independence from the state union . The vote for severing ties with Serbia exceeded 55 % - the threshold set by the EU - allowing Montenegro to formally declare its independence on 3 June 2006 . Basutoland was renamed the Kingdom of Lesotho upon independence from the UK in 1966 . The Basuto National Party ruled for the first two decades . Xinhua said the fire broke out Saturday at a mine in Hegang City , Heilongjiang province , while 44 miners were working underground . King MOSHOESHOE was exiled in 1990 , but returned to Lesotho in 1992 and was reinstated in 1995 and subsequently succeeded by his son , King LETSIE III , in 1996 . Constitutional government was restored in 1993 after seven years of military rule . In 1998 , violent protests and a military mutiny following a contentious election prompted a brief but bloody intervention by South African and Botswana military forces under the aegis of the Southern African Development Community . Subsequent constitutional reforms restored relative political stability . Peaceful parliamentary elections were held in 2002 , but the National Assembly elections of February 2007 were hotly contested and aggrieved parties continue to dispute how the electoral law was applied to award proportional seats in the Assembly . Tourism , petroleum refining , and offshore finance are the mainstays of this small economy , which is closely tied to the outside world . Although GDP grew slightly during the past decade , the island enjoys a high per capita income and a well-developed infrastructure compared with other countries in the region . Curacao has an excellent natural harbor that can accommodate large oil tankers . The Venezuelan state oil company leases the single refinery on the island from the government ; most of the oil for the refinery is imported from Venezuela ; most of the refined products are exported to the US . Almost all consumer and capital goods are imported , with the US , Brazil , Italy , and Mexico being the major suppliers . China 's coal mines are the world 's deadliest , with thousands of people dying every year in explosions , cave-ins and floods . The government is attempting to diversify its industry and trade and has signed an Association Agreement with the EU to expand business there . Poor soils and inadequate water supplies hamper the development of agriculture . Budgetary problems complicate reform of the health and pension systems for an aging population . A quarrel had arisen between the Horse and the Stag , so the Horse came to a Hunter to ask his help to take revenge on the Stag .

Then with the aid of the Hunter the Horse soon overcame the Stag , and said to the Hunter : \" Now , get off , and remove those things from my mouth and back . \" \" Not so fast , friend , \" said the Hunter . \" I have now got you under bit and spur , and prefer to keep you as you are at present . \" If you allow men to use you for your own purposes , they will use you for theirs .

He also said Judge Alito has the qualities the American people expect - mastery of the law , a deep commitment to justice , and great personal character . On Friday , the president told reporters he is disappointed that Senate confirmation hearings will not take place until January 9 for the man he hopes will succeed retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor . Mr. Bush nominated Judge Alito October 31 , four days after his first nominee Harriet Miers withdrew amid criticism that she lacked judicial experience .

United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan says he is deeply disappointed in the decision of Burma 's military rulers to extend the house arrest of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi for another six months . The statement by Mr. Annan says the continued detention is not in the interest of Burma 's national reconciliation and democratization . Aung San Suu Kyi , the head of the National League for Democracy , has spent 10 of the past 16 years in detention , mostly under house arrest . Her current sentence was due to expire this month . Mark Farmaner of Burma Campaign UK told VOA 's Burmese Service that Aung San Suu Kyi 's detention was extended because the junta 's ruling generals hope the world will forget about her . The United States and the European Union have imposed sanctions on Burma for its suppression of the pro-democracy movement . The Sunnis have already been granted 11 extra seats on the committee to make up for their small number of legislators - a result of the parliament election boycott by Sunni voters .

South Korea 's troops have been assigned to relief and rehabilitation efforts in the northern Iraqi town of Arbil since 2004 . After the United States and Britain , Seoul 's troops make up the third-largest force in Iraq . A new medical report says secondhand smoke can be just as harmful as smoking , and separate sections for smokers and nonsmokers in restaurants and bars do not help . The U.S. Surgeon General , America 's top medical official , released the report Tuesday . It says only smoke-free buildings and public places really protect nonsmokers from disease-causing agents in tobacco smoke . The report says children are particularly vulnerable to secondhand smoke . Shi'ite leaders have not responded to the demands . It says children in homes where parents smoke are at increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome , lung infections and more severe asthma . A 2005 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that secondhand smoke causes some 3,000 deaths each year from lung cancer , and 46,000 deaths from heart disease . Secondhand smoke is also blamed for 430 infant deaths annually in the United States .

The Swedish Security Service said Friday there was no imminent threat of an attack . It said the shift was linked to groups in Sweden , but did not provide any further details . Sweden 's move comes after a report earlier this week of a potential terror plot being hatched in Pakistan to attack several European capitals .

French police strengthened their cordon around the city of Strasbourg after detaining 300 people during clashes between protesters and police . Cindy Sheehan came to Crawford a week ago demanding to talk to Mr. Bush about the death of her son and the rationale behind the Iraq conflict . Officials say about 100 demonstrators are still in custody .

It says its North American division is struggling . But overall , GM reported earlier this month that it sold more than two percent more cars this January than it had one year ago . That increase followed sales declines reported by other major car companies . White House spokeswoman Dana Perino today said GM 's loss is \" significant . \" But she cited the company 's restructuring efforts and expressed optimism that the automaker would remain competitive . Authorities turned out in force to keep the two groups separated . Italian officials say Taleban forces may have kidnapped an Italian journalist missing in southern Afghanistan for three days .

No date has been given for those talks . Tensions between Fatah and Hamas have been high for months . Last month , forces from each side fought open street battles in Gaza and the West Bank . At least 17 people died in that fighting . A ceasefire agreed to last week has largely ended the violence , but has done little to resolve the standoff . A presidential panel says U.S. intelligence about Iran 's arms capabilities is \" inadequate . \" The first round of historic trade negotiations between Australia and China is under way in Sydney . A free trade agreement between the two countries would boost China 's effort to be accepted as a full market economy and would provide Australia with access to the world 's largest marketplace . The chairman of China 's National People 's Congress told trade forum members Monday that relations between the two countries have never been better . China is Australia 's third-largest trading partner . China supplies consumer goods and clothing while key Australian exports include iron ore , wheat , petroleum and coal .

A U.N. humanitarian coordinator in the quake zone , Rashid Khalikov , called the agreement a good step that will help extend aid to people in isolated areas . But with a bitter Himalayan winter approaching and millions of people homeless or needing shelter , aid workers fear hunger , disease , diarrhea and injuries that are not treated could kill thousands more . The report says America lacks the intelligence on Tehran 's arms to allow firm judgments about its weapons programs . Some 2,00,000 people are still without any humanitarian aid three weeks after the quake that killed about 55,000 people , most of them in Pakistani Kashmir .

Cuba 's main labor organization says the state is to lay off more than 5,00,000 public sector workers by March . The Cuban Workers Confederation said the country can not and should not continue supporting businesses , production entities and services with inflated payrolls . It said the losses hurt the economy and are ultimately counterproductive , creating bad habits and distorting worker conduct . In the statement released on state-run media , the union said Cuba would change its labor structure and salary system and increase private sector job opportunities . Currently , the state employs 95 percent of the official work force . Several weeks ago , Cuban President Raul Castro said his government would scale back its involvement in the nation 's economy and allow more Cubans to operate their own businesses and hire workers .

The Israeli army says it targeted a weapons storage facility . Israeli police say a Palestinian suicide bomber has critically wounded two Israeli security guards in the Israeli city of Beersheba . Ali Larijani also told a news conference Wednesday that Iran 's main enrichment plant is ready for use . Police say the bomber detonated his explosives outside the city 's main bus station during the morning rush hour . There has been no immediate claim of responsibility . Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas condemned the bombing - the first such attack since Israel began withdrawing Jewish settlers from the Gaza Strip earlier this month . Meanwhile , the Israeli cabinet has approved the deployment of Egyptian police along Egypt 's border with Gaza . Under an agreement with Cairo , Egypt is to position 750 border police on the Egyptian side to replace Israeli troops trying to block cross-border smuggling . Israel says all of its forces in Gaza will leave the border area by the end of September . Hamas ' political leader says the Islamic group will not renew a truce with Israel that expires at the end of this year . At a rally in a Palestinian refugee camp near the Syrian capital Friday , Khaled Mashaal said Hamas would not enter a new truce while the Palestinian people are preparing for a new round of conflict . Later , Mr. Mashaal told al-Jazeera television that the current truce would not be affected , but that calls for extending it are unrealistic . He accused Israel of carrying out targeted assassinations , arrests and airstrikes in violation of the truce . He said all Iran has to do is inform the International Atomic Energy Agency that it would be resuming operations . Israel says such actions are in self-defense . The Associated Press reports the Palestinian Authority said Mr. Mashaal 's statement was \" irresponsible \" and a violation of the truce . The commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan says the international community has underestimated the resurgence of the Taleban , partly because the war in Iraq diverted attention and resources . Lieutenant-General David Richards told BBC Thursday that the international community \" took their eye off this ball and a vacuum was allowed to develop \" in Afghanistan . The British general said the war in Iraq absorbed people 's interest and resources for a while . But he said he is optimistic the insurgency in Afghanistan can be defeated . Afghanistan in recent months has suffered the worst violence since a U.S.-led attack ousted the Taleban government in December 2001 , in part for failing to hand over Osama bin Laden . Fighting Thursday left 12 suspected Taleban militants dead in southern Nawzad district . A coalition soldier was also killed by a landmine in the same province . Burma 's official media reported Saturday that troops confiscated grenades and other weapons from a border hide-out used by suspected drug traffickers , after an earlier gunbattle killed 13 policemen and members of their patrol . Most of the world 's cases , 103 , have occurred in Indonesia . His comments come one day before the IAEA board meets in Vienna . The state-run New Light of Myanmar said the shoot-out took place February 20 near the northeastern town of Tachileik , which borders Thailand . The report said an anti-drug squad was patrolling the Mekong river near Tachileik when it encountered drug traffickers and a gunbattle broke out . Eight policemen were killed , along with two local militia members and three police boat drivers . Two police officers were wounded . The paper said that police , acting on a tip , found 15 tents several days later on an island in the Mekong . Authorities seized grenades , rifles , ammunition and blocks of caffeine - an ingredient of methamphetamine tablets . U.S.-led coalition forces in Afghanistan say troops killed 24 Taleban fighters in a seven-hour battle in the country 's restive south . A coalition statement said the fight happened Wednesday in the Sangin district of Helmand province . Two coalition soldiers were wounded . Meanwhile , Amnesty International said Taleban insurgents are deliberately targeting civilians in Afghanistan to instill fear and exert control over the population . A draft resolution obtained by news agencies formally calls on the IAEA to report Iran to the U.N. Security Council over its nuclear activities . The London-based rights group said civilians are increasingly facing suicide attacks , abductions and beheadings . The organization said Taleban militants have a deliberate policy of killing teachers , abducting aid workers and burning school buildings . Amnesty said at least 756 civilians were killed in 2006 , mostly from roadside bombs and suicide attacks . The rising cost of living is hurting a growing number of Americans , especially those who live on fixed incomes . Among the hardest hit are retirees . More and more are finding that the money they set aside for their golden years may not be enough to take care of their needs . It 's an issue an estimated 46 million Americans will grapple with as they reach retirement age this year . VOA 's Mil Arcega reports . Iraqi authorities say 50 suspected insurgents have been detained in connection with Sunday 's suicide car bombings in the nation 's two holiest Shi'ite cities , Najaf and Karbala . Hospital officials say the death toll from the carnage has risen to 66 - at least 52 lives lost in Najaf and 14 in Karbala . British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw met his Iranian counterpart Manouchehr Mottaki in London today to tell him that Tehran has one last chance to convince the world that its nuclear program is peaceful . More than 140 people were wounded by the explosions . Shi'ite Muslim leaders have appealed for calm , saying such attacks are clearly attempts to ignite sectarian violence and prevent Iraq 's first post-Saddam elections , scheduled to take place in six weeks , on January 30 . Shi'ite leaders are urging their followers not to resort to revenge attacks , but to focus on the upcoming national elections . The United Nations says that restoring tens of thousands of degraded wetlands around the world could help reduce the threat of a bird flu pandemic . Preliminary findings of the report were released Tuesday during a conference at the U.N. Environment Program headquarters in Nairobi , Kenya . The report says the loss of wetlands is forcing many wild birds into alternative habitats like farm ponds and paddy fields . It says these habitats increase the risk of the birds spreading avian flu to domestic birds like chickens . The U.N. agency says current efforts to curb the spread of the disease , like isolation or destroying birds , are likely quick fixes that offer limited short-term benefits . Bird flu has killed more than 100 people since 2003 , mostly in East Asia . The disease also has been detected in birds in parts of Africa , the Middle East and Europe . European and U.S. leaders accuse Iran of secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons . The African Union 's peace and security council has called on all African countries to impose sanctions against Togo over the military 's installation of President Faure Gnassingbe . The council Friday backed sanctions by the West African group ECOWAS , and urged the AU 's 53 members to follow suit . ECOWAS has agreed to slap an arms embargo and travel ban on Togolese officials . Also Friday , the vice president of Togo 's ruling party , George Dahoun Gignor , told VOA that Mr. Gnassingbe must step down , saying the embattled leader has no choice . However , the ruling party Friday backed Mr. Gnassingbe as its candidate in presidential elections expected within 60 days . President Gnassingbe told cheering party members he accepted the nomination . He took power earlier this month after the death of his father , Gnassingbe Eyadema . United Nations peacekeeping troops in Haiti have surrounded the residence of ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide , threatening to forcefully evict demobilized soldiers who have seized the compound . Haiti 's interim government has ordered the rebels out of the compound in the suburb of Tabarre . The government said Thursday U.N. troops will do whatever is necessary to clear the residence . Iran denies the charge . The ex-soldiers - who helped lead the three-week rebellion that ousted Mr. Aristide in February - moved into the compound on Wednesday . Mr. Aristide is in exile in South Africa . British police have arrested a suspect wanted in Spain in connection with last year 's March 11 train bombings in Madrid in which nearly 200 people died . Police identified the man as 39-year-old Spaniard Moutaz Almallah Dabas . They said they were acting on an extradition warrant from Spain when they took him into custody at Slough , west of London . Mr. Almallah Dabas is wanted for alleged terrorist offenses linked to the Madrid train bombings . He is due to appear in London 's Bow Street magistrate 's court on Monday . On Friday , Spanish police arrested his brother , Mohannad Almallah Dabas , who holds a Syrian passport , also in connection with the Madrid train bombings . The United States is revitalizing efforts to jumpstart six-party talks on North Korea 's nuclear ambitions . In an interview with Reuters and AFP , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice says the United States has already made Pyongyang \" a very good proposal \" and is waiting for it to be accepted . U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice says the Bush administration has a strategy to \" assure victory \" in Iraq . North Korea has so far refused to return for a fourth round of talks , alleging the United States plans to launch military strikes against it - an idea Ms. Rice calls \" farfetched . \" Meanwhile , a senior U.S. official is in Seoul for talks with South Korean officials after stops in Tokyo and Beijing . Michael Green , director for Asian affairs on the U.S. National Security Council , says the Bush administration is holding out hope that Pyongyang will return to the negotiations . Italian chemical giant Montedison S.p.A. , through its Montedison Acquisition N.V. indirect unit , began its $ 37-a-share tender offer for all the common shares outstanding of Erbamont N.V. , a maker of pharmaceuticals incorporated in the Netherlands . The offer , advertised in today 's editions of The Wall Street Journal , is scheduled to expire at the end of November . Montedison currently owns about 72 % of Erbamont 's common shares outstanding . The offer is being launched pursuant to a previously announced agreement between the companies . Burkina Faso ( formerly Upper Volta ) achieved independence from France in 1960 . Repeated military coups during the 1970s and 1980s were followed by multiparty elections in the early 1990s . Current President Blaise COMPAORE came to power in a 1987 military coup and has won every election since then . In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , Ms. Rice said the plan is to clear out areas under insurgent control , hold those areas securely , and build durable , national Iraqi institutions . Burkina Faso 's high population density and limited natural resources result in poor economic prospects for the majority of its citizens . Recent unrest in Cote d'Ivoire and northern Ghana has hindered the ability of several hundred thousand seasonal Burkinabe farm workers to find employment in neighboring countries . Once one of the wealthiest of the Yugoslav republics , Croatia 's economy suffered badly during the 1991 - 95 war as output collapsed and the country missed the early waves of investment in Central and Eastern Europe that followed the fall of the Berlin Wall . Between 2000 and 2007 , however , Croatia 's economic fortunes began to improve slowly , with moderate but steady GDP growth between 4 % and 6 % led by a rebound in tourism and credit-driven consumer spending . Inflation over the same period has remained tame and the currency , the kuna , stable . Nevertheless , difficult problems still remain , including a stubbornly high unemployment rate , a growing trade deficit and uneven regional development . The state retains a large role in the economy , as privatization efforts often meet stiff public and political resistance . While macroeconomic stabilization has largely been achieved , structural reforms lag because of deep resistance on the part of the public and lack of strong support from politicians . The EU accession process should accelerate fiscal and structural reform . While long term growth prospects for the economy remain strong , Croatia will face significant pressure as a result of the global financial crisis . She said the United States will send in teams of diplomatic and military personnel working together to help Iraqis train police , and set up essential services . Croatia 's high foreign debt , anemic export sector , strained state budget , and over-reliance on tourism revenue will result in higher risk to economic stability over the medium term . Morocco annexed the northern two-thirds of Western Sahara ( formerly Spanish Sahara ) in 1976 and claimed the rest of the territory in 1979 , following Mauritania 's withdrawal . A guerrilla war with the Polisario Front contesting Morocco 's sovereignty ended in a 1991 UN-brokered cease-fire ; a UN-organized referendum on the territory 's final status has been repeatedly postponed . The UN since 2007 has sponsored intermittent talks between representatives of the Government of Morocco and the Polisario Front to negotiate the status of Western Sahara . Morocco has put forward an autonomy proposal for the territory , which would allow for some local administration while maintaining Moroccan sovereignty . The Polisario , with Algeria 's support , demands a popular referendum that includes the option of independence . The Genoese built a fortress on the site of present day Monaco in 1215 . The current ruling Grimaldi family first seized temporary control in 1297 , and again in 1331 , but were not able to permanently secure their holding until 1419 . Economic development was spurred in the late 19th century with a railroad linkup to France and the opening of a casino . Since then , the principality 's mild climate , splendid scenery , and gambling facilities have made Monaco world famous as a tourist and recreation center . Ms. Rice 's testimony Wednesday comes just days after Iraqis voted in a referendum on a new constitution . A CRAB , forsaking the seashore , chose a neighboring green meadow as its feeding ground . A Fox came across him , and being very hungry ate him up . Just as he was on the point of being eaten , the Crab said , \" I well deserve my fate , for what business had I on the land , when by my nature and habits I am only adapted for the sea ? ' Contentment with our lot is an element of happiness . A GROOM used to spend whole days in currycombing and rubbing down his Horse , but at the same time stole his oats and sold them for his own profit . \" Alas ! \" said the Horse , \" if you really wish me to be in good condition , you should groom me less , and feed me more . \" A POLITICAL Leader was walking out one sunny day , when he observed his Shadow leaving him and walking rapidly away . \" Come back here , you scoundrel , \" he cried . \" If I had been a scoundrel , \" answered the Shadow , increasing its speed , \" I should not have left you . \" The makers of French 's Mustard made the following recent statement : Senators pressed the secretary for specifics , including when the 150-thousand U.S. troops in Iraq might start coming home . We at the French 's Company wish to put an end to statements that our product is manufactured in France . There is no relationship , nor has there ever been a relationship , between our mustard and the country of France . Indeed , our mustard in manufactured in Rochester , NY . The only thing we have in common is that we are both yellow . At least our team is trying to win a game . Coach went out and set up our new pitching machine the other day . Unfortunately it beat us 04-Jan . Clinton 's mother prayed fervently that Bill would grow up and be president . So far , half of her prayer has been answered . Applied excessively , styling gel could cause you to have a hair-raising experience . Witnesses in Somalia say insurgents have burned and dragged the bodies of at least two soldiers through the streets of Mogadishu , after a clash between militants and Ethiopian forces killed seven people . The secretary refused to offer a timetable , saying any withdrawal depends on Iraqi forces being able to fight the insurgents independently . India says it is increasing security to thwart possible militant strikes in the country . Indian Home Minister P. Chidambaram Tuesday warned reporters against creating an alarmist picture and said India is increasing its level of preparedness to meet any terror threat or attack . The minister 's comments come just days after Israel said it has information that the same group that carried out the 2008 attacks in Mumbai , India , is planning another assault against Western and Israeli targets in the country . Israel 's counter-terrorism bureau released a statement Thursday , September 17 , saying it has information that terrorists are planning a number of attacks across India , and may be focusing on hitting groups of Israelis and Westerners . India is a popular destination for Israeli tourists , especially during Jewish festivals such as the traditional new year , which began Friday . The United States , Israel and Australia have issued travel advisories to their citizens . India 's holiday season includes Hindu , Islamic and secular holidays , as well as the period surrounding the commemoration of the September 11 , 2001 terror attacks on the United States . Ugandan 's president says his country could increase the number of troops it has in Somalia as part of the African Union peacekeeping force . In a statement Thursday , President Yoweri Museveni says Uganda is \" capable \" of providing all 8,000 troops authorized for the force by the AU . The statement says he made the comment to United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon on Wednesday , on the sidelines of the AU summit in Ethiopia . English and Irish colonists from St. Kitts first settled on Montserrat in 1632 ; the first African slaves arrived three decades later . Mr. Museveni told the U.N. leader he has to discuss the matter with his High Command first but will inform Mr. Ban of the decision . Uganda and Burundi have deployed a total of about 2,000 troops to Somalia , where the Somali government and allied Ethiopian troops have been battling an Islamist-led insurgency for more than a year . Fighting centered in Mogadishu has killed thousands of people and prompted more than 6,00,000 others to flee the city . Mr. Ban has expressed concern that few African countries have fulfilled their promise of troops for the AU peacekeeping froce . Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe named an electoral commission to run parliamentary elections expected in March . The main opposition , Movement for Democratic Change said it had no confidence in the commission . Justice minister Patrick Chinamasa announced that Mr. Mugabe appointed a 5-member body under the chairmanship of High Court Judge , George Chiweshe , who was appointed by President Robert Mugabe , leader of Zimbabwe 's ruling Zanu-PF party . Judge Chiweshe made legal history in 2002 when he told the High Court that the state did not have to provide any evidence to continue to detain a critically ill opposition member of parliament who was trying to get out of prison on bail . He was also appointed by Mr. Mugabe to draw up a new map of voting districts released before Christmas . The MDC expressed concerns over Mr. Chiweshe 's appointment because of the voter redistricting which removed three of the MDC 's stronghold constituencies . The British and French fought for possession of the island for most of the 18th century , but it finally was confirmed as a British possession in 1783 . Mr. Chinamasa insisted that the commission reflects an all-inclusive consultation process , incorporating all three parties represented in Zimbabwe 's parliament , including the MDC . But , new electoral laws signed into law by Mr. Mugabe last week , for the first time give the military , police and prison officials a substantial role in the next poll , and they can , if recruited to serve , control voting and counting . There was a frenzy of lawmaking late last year to establish new legislation and electoral authorities ahead of the poll which Mr. Mugabe says will be held in March ahead of his 25th anniversary of coming to power in 1980 . The MDC suspended participation in all elections five months ago because it said the electoral playing field was uneven . It said it would only take part when Zimbabwe 's laws and practice complied with regional electoral principles agreed to by Mr. Mugabe and other southern African countries last August . However most political analysts believe the MDC will take part in the general election , despite Zimbabwe 's lack of compliance with regional electoral practices and laws . Western observers are not expected to be invited to cover Zimbabwe 's poll as they said the last two national elections were neither free nor fair . In a weekend of second-round qualifiers for the 2012 African Cup of Nations , no result was more surprising than Niger 's 1-0 upset of reigning African champions Egypt . Football fans in Niger 's capital celebrated throughout the night , blowing horns and singing the praises of their Menas ' win over the Pharaohs of Egypt . It was a stunning upset , even for the most loyal of Niger 's football faithful . The island 's sugar plantation economy was converted to small farm landholdings in the mid 19th century . FIFA ranks Egypt 9th in the world . Niger : 154th . Niamey 's 35,000 seat Stade Général Seyni Kountché was full long before the mid-afternoon kick-off under a blistering sun . Striker Ouwa Moussa Maazou scored the only goal in the first half , getting past Egyptian defender Mohamed Abel Shafy who failed to clear . Goalkeeper Essam el-Hadary charged Maazou , but the 22-year-old striker - who is on loan from French club Bordeaux - slipped the ball past him into the net . Egypt pressed for the equalizer at the start of the second half , but rarely got much past midfield . Their best chance came off a free kick in the 76th minute . But Mahmoud Fathallah was ruled offside . Maazou 's goal and solid defense gives Niger three points in Group G and drops Egypt to the bottom of the group with only one point after two matches , following their opening 01-Jan draw with Sierra Leone in Cairo . It was an inauspicious start for the record seven-time continental champions , who next play South Africa in Johannesburg . Much of this island was devastated and two-thirds of the population fled abroad because of the eruption of the Soufriere Hills Volcano that began on 18 July 1995 . Niger hosts Sierra Leone as it pushes to qualify for the 2012 tournament in Equatorial Guinea and Gabon . Iraqi officials say a car bomb targeting a police patrol has killed six people and wounded at least 11 more in a city north of Baghdad . Police said Thursday the blast took place in central Tikrit , hometown of former dictator Saddam Hussein . They said four police officers were among the dead and several others were wounded . Overall violence in Iraq has yet to match the peak reached in 2006 and 2007 . However , insurgents have intensified attacks since inconclusive March elections left the country without a governing coalition . Sylvester Stallone faces stiff fines in Australia , where he is accused of importing a muscle-building hormone . The movie star was detained Feb. 16 in the Sydney airport , while authorities searched his hotel room . He and his group subsequently left the country , and he was not compelled to attend the March 13 hearing . He is accused of possessing human growth hormone , classified in Australia as a restricted performance-enhancing drug . Montserrat has endured volcanic activity since , with the last eruption occurring in July 2003 . The maximum penalty for illegal possession is a fine of $ 86,000 and five years in prison . Stallone is unlikely to face such a sentence . Police in western India say at least 52 people were killed and at least eight others injured Thursday , when a train collided with a tractor carrying a wedding party . Police say the accident happened in a small village in Maharashtra state , some 800 kilometers northeast of Bombay , also known as Mumbai . They say a local train bound for the central city of Nagpur smashed into a tractor as it was crossing the tracks . Accidents are relatively frequent on India 's railway network , which handles 13 million passengers on 14,000 trains every day . In December , a head-on collision of two passenger trains in Punjab state brought opposition party calls for the resignation of Railways Minister Laloo Prasad Yadav . At least 37 people died in that crash . The New York City Fire Department has released thousands of pages of oral histories and hours of radio transmissions from the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center . A New York State court of appeals ruled in March that the items must be made public . Georgia 's economy sustained GDP growth of more than 10 % in 2006 - 7 , based on strong inflows of foreign investment and robust government spending . The oral histories were complied by firefighters shortly after the attacks on the twin towers , and include accounts from firefighters and emergency medical personnel who were on the scene . The New York Times newspaper and families of the victims of the attacks had sued for the release of the material . The city had said it wanted to protect the privacy of those involved , and not jeopardize the case against Zacarias Moussaoui , who later pleaded guilty to conspiring with the hijackers . The United Nations says the December 26 Indian Ocean tsunami dumped tons of hazardous waste on the shores of Somalia . A spokesman for the U.N. Environment Program says containers filled with nuclear , chemical and medical waste broke apart when they washed ashore , and have been spread by the weather . The spokesman says there have been reports from northern Somalia of illnesses consistent with radiation sickness , including respiratory infections , mouth ulcers , abdominal hemorrhages and unusual skin diseases . The United Nations says foreign companies , many from Europe , began dumping toxic waste on Somalia 's shore in the 1980s , but the practice accelerated after the 1991 overthrow of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre . The tsunami is believed to have dislodged the hazardous materials . Japan has pledged $ 17 billion in development aid to other Asian countries for infrastructure projects that will help boost growth . Speaking Saturday to the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso also repeated a pledge to lend $ 100 billion to the International Monetary Fund . However , GDP growth slowed in 2008 following the August 2008 conflict with Russia , and turned negative in 2009 as foreign direct investment and workers ' remittances declined in the wake of the global financial crisis , but rebounded in 2010 . Mr. Aso also announced a new greenhouse gas emissions plan for Japan and pledged to announce emissions targets by June . The Japanese leader planned to spend only half a day in the Swiss mountain resort and return home by late Sunday to deal with a stormy session of parliament , where the opposition hopes for a victory in elections that are required to be held this year . More than 5,000 U.S. , Iraqi and British troops have swept through an Iraqi town south of Baghdad in the latest operation against insurgents ahead of January elections . The U.S. military says troops arrested 32 suspected insurgents in Jabella Tuesday . The raid follows operations in Fallujah and the northern city of Mosul . U.S. Defense Minister Donald Rumsfeld says those operations show how much insurgents are opposed to a democratic Iraq . He warned that attacks will likely increase ahead of the elections . Meanwhile , foreign ministers from Arab and Western countries met Tuesday in Egypt and said full participation in the vote is the key to reconciliation in Iraq . In another development , a Sunni Muslim cleric was gunned down outside a mosque north of Baghdad . Terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden apparently has surfaced on an audiotape calling for the overthrow of Saudi Arabia 's government . Georgia 's main economic activities include the cultivation of agricultural products such as grapes , citrus fruits , and hazelnuts ; mining of manganese and copper ; and output of a small industrial sector producing alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages , metals , machinery , aircraft and chemicals . The lengthy message criticizes the Saudi monarchy , saying its attempts at reform will not change anything and that change will only come through armed struggle and the government 's overthrow . Authorities say the authenticity of the tape , which surfaced Thursday on an Islamist website , could not immediately be verified . He also praises the militants who attacked the U.S. consulate in the Saudi city of Jeddah earlier this month , asking God to be merciful on them . Four of the attackers were killed , a fifth was arrested . Five consulate staff members who were not American were also killed . Osama bin Laden remains a fugitive . He was last heard from in a videotape shortly before the U.S. presidential elections last month . The U.S.-led military forces in Afghanistan say more than a dozen militants were killed in a day-long battle in southern part of the country Saturday . A coalition and an Afghan soldier were also killed in the fighting . Saturday 's fighting took place in southern Helmand province . Areas of recent improvement include growth in the construction , banking services , and mining sectors , but reduced availability of external investment and the slowing regional economy are emerging risks . Coalition and Afghan forces called for air strikes on militant positions after coming under attack in the area . Also in the south , Taleban militants executed the kidnapped son of a district police chief . The victim was reported to be between 14 and 18-years-old . In other violence , a roadside bomb hit an Afghan army convoy killing at least two soldiers and wounding three others in the western Farah province on Sunday . A Taleban spokesperson has taken responsibility for the deadly blast . The World Food Program ( WFP ) warns that fighting in Chad could leave up to 7,00,000 people short of food . The U.N. agency expressed concern that violence will delay truck convoys trying to reach refugees in eastern Chad and displaced people in Sudan 's Darfur region . The agency says the trucks must get through before the end of next month , when seasonal rains are expected to make road travel impossible . Chad 's government is fighting an insurgency that President Idriss Deby says is backed by Sudan . The Sudanese government denies the charge . The violence erupted Wednesday after insurgents attacked Ethiopian tanks rolling through an insurgent stronghold near the headquarters of the former Defense Ministry in southern Mogadishu . The country imports nearly all its needed supplies of natural gas and oil products . The World Food Program says it remains operational in Chad despite recent clashes that led it to evacuate non-essential staff . The agency says it is wrapping up April food distribution in eastern Chad , where it looks after some 2,00,000 refugees from Darfur . The agency feeds another 5,00,000 displaced Sudanese in Darfur itself . Police in the northeastern U.S. state of Connecticut say a disgruntled employee at a beer distribution firm went on a shooting spree at his place of employment , leaving nine people dead including himself . A labor union official says the suspect was a driver who had worked at the company , Hartford Distributors . He apparently went on a rampage Tuesday , after being summoned for a disciplinary hearing . The shooting took place at 7.30 in the morning at a company warehouse , while a large number of people were inside the building during a shift change . Police say , after the rampage , it appears the gunman shot and killed himself . Afghan officials are welcoming the Netherlands ' decision to keep its troops in southern Afghanistan , but the officials say the international community must do more to equip domestic forces . Afghan Defense Ministry officials Saturday said the extension of the Dutch mission is a positive step . It has sizeable hydropower capacity , a growing component of its energy supplies . But they said further training of Afghan troops is necessary to ensure long-term security in Afghanistan . The Dutch government announced Friday it will extend the mandate of its troops until 2010 . The soldiers serve as part of a NATO force . Around 1,700 Dutch troops have been deployed in the southern Uruzgan province , where NATO and U.S.-led forces are fighting fierce battles against Taliban militants . A renewed Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan has turned this year into the deadliest yet since the 2001 U.S.-led invasion ousted the Taliban government . The prime minister of Pakistan , Shaukat Aziz , has called for European help in repatriating three million Afghan refugees in his country . Mr. Aziz says refugee camps along the border with Afghanistan provide safe havens for terrorists . The prime minister also promised to strengthen efforts to restrict cross-border attacks into Afghanistan . The Pakistan government has proposed a controversial plan to fence and mine parts of the mountainous border . Mr. Aziz is in Belgium , holding talks with European Union and NATO leaders . Georgia has overcome the chronic energy shortages and gas supply interruptions of the past by renovating hydropower plants and by increasingly relying on natural gas imports from Azerbaijan instead of from Russia . After Tuesday 's meeting , NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer called for an end to criticism of Pakistan 's efforts to contain militants . Scheffer said it does not make sense to have a public \" blame game . \" The Afghan government and the United States have both accused Pakistan of failing to clamp down on Taleban insurgents based in Pakistan who launch attacks into Afghanistan . Police in Indonesia have asked churches to prepare for possible Christmas attacks by digging holes for suspicious objects that might be bombs . Officials in the central Java city of Solo said Friday they are requesting churches put any suspicious object into a one-meter deep hole to store until a bomb squad can arrive . Earlier this month , Jakarta 's police chief said he will deploy up to 17,000 security officers to safeguard the Indonesian capital during the upcoming Christian holiday season . Five years ago , militants bombed 11 churches on Christmas Eve , killing 19 people . Police suspect the radical Jemaah Islamiyah group was responsible . Shops , businesses , and offices were shut in Indian-controlled Kashmir Monday , after separatists called a strike to protest the death of a teenager . Seventeen-year-old Tufail Ahmad Matoo was killed in the main town of Srinagar Friday during clashes between anti-India protesters and police . The construction on the Baku-T'bilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline , the Baku-T'bilisi-Erzerum gas pipeline , and the Kars-Akhalkalaki Railroad are part of a strategy to capitalize on Georgia 's strategic location between Europe and Asia and develop its role as a transit point for gas , oil and other goods . Residents say Mattoo was hit by a teargas shell fired by police and was carrying a school bag when he was hit . Police say they are investigating the death . Clashes between demonstrators and security forces have erupted in Srinagar since the incident , with strict security restrictions in place to prevent further violence . Kashmiri Muslim separatists have been fighting for two decades for independence from India or a merger with Muslim-majority Pakistan . The insurgency has killed more than 47,000 people . Kashmir is divided between India and Pakistan , but claimed in its entirety by both . The neighbors have fought two wars over the region . Hundreds of millions of Christians worldwide are celebrating Christmas Saturday . Pope John Paul , in his traditional Christmas Day message , expressed concern at violence in the Middle East and Africa . The Roman Catholic pontiff said he follows the situation in Iraq with \" great apprehension . \" Georgia has historically suffered from a chronic failure to collect tax revenues ; however , the government , since coming to power in 2004 , has simplified the tax code , improved tax administration , increased tax enforcement , and cracked down on petty corruption . He said he has \" anxious concern \" about the situation in the Holy Land but also feels \" invincible confidence \" at the prospects for peace there . President Bush issued a Christmas Day call for Americans to volunteer to help the neediest of their fellow citizens . The President also acknowledged Americans serving in Afghanistan , Iraq and elsewhere around the world .

Russian President Vladimir Putin attended a Christmas Eve service at a cathedral in the Siberian city of Yakutsk . In a message to citizens , Mr. Putin urged them to follow the Christmas tradition of helping those in need . However , the economic downturn of 2008 - 9 eroded the tax base and led to a decline in the budget surplus and an increase in public borrowing needs . In Rome , Pope Benedict extended Christmas greetings to Orthodox Christians as Roman Catholics marked the feast of the Epiphany - the Three Kings or Wise Men who tradition says brought gifts to Jesus following his birth . Many Orthodox churches celebrate Christmas on the Julian calendar - about two weeks later than most other Christians . The Indian foreign ministry says India and Pakistan will hold the first meeting of a joint anti-terrorism panel in March . The talks will be held in Pakistan 's capital , Islamabad , on March 6 . The idea for the panel was first proposed last year during a meeting in Cuba between Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf . The initiative was created after deadly train bombings in Mumbai in July . India claimed Pakistan 's top intelligence agency ( ISI ) played a role in the attack , a charged denied by Pakistan . Efforts to improve relations between India and Pakistan began with a peace process in 2004 . The two countries have fought three wars and have yet to resolve their dispute over the region of Kashmir , where an anti-India insurgency has killed tens of thousands since 1989 . World number-two men 's tennis player Rafael Nadal of Spain has withdrawn from the season 's first Grand Slam tournament , the Australian Open , which begins Monday in Melbourne . The country is pinning its hopes for renewed growth on a determined effort to continue to liberalize the economy by reducing regulation , taxes , and corruption in order to attract foreign investment , but the economy faces a more difficult investment climate both domestically and internationally . The 19-year-old French Open champion said on his website Tuesday that he would be unable to play because of a foot injury he suffered in October at the Madrid Masters . He has not played a tour event since . Nadal joins American Andre Agassi on the sidelines for the tournament , which could still lose Russians Marat Safin and Maria Sharapova because of fitness doubts .

In an interview with VOA Wednesday the U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs , Nicholas Burns , said Pakistan 's plan to lay land mines along parts of its border with Afghanistan is a bilateral issue . Afghan officials have opposed the plan , saying it will do little to prevent terrorism . Afghanistan has repeatedly accused Pakistan of not doing enough to stop Taleban militants from infiltrating their shared border . Burns also said he hopes the two sides can resolve a wave of Taleban-led attacks on civilians and NATO forces inside Afghanistan . Fighting in Afghanistan increased dramatically last year , killing thousands and igniting tensions between Kabul and Islamabad .

Cyprus Foreign Minister George Iacovou says his European Union counterparts have agreed on a statement responding to Turkey 's refusal to recognize the internationally backed Cypriot government . Mr. Iacovou gave no details of the statement . But he told the Cyprus News Agency the ministers left it up to ambassadors of the 25 EU countries to work out the final text of the document . Earlier , Turkey 's Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul warned his country will abandon its EU membership bid if the bloc imposes new conditions on Ankara , or tries to offer anything less than full membership . This strategy placed the country on a slow and steady growth path from an extremely low level . Turkey has insisted that recognition of the Greek-led Cypriot government depends on a resolution of the three-decade division of Cyprus . EU ministers have been pressing Turkey to normalize relations with all EU members , including Cyprus . Turkey is scheduled to start EU membership talks next month .

A group of Iraqi lawmakers loyal to Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr has staged a protest against a proposal allowing British troops to remain in the country . The Sadrist politicians walked out of a session of parliament Saturday , suspending consideration of the proposal . The deal would allow up to 100 British troops to stay in Iraq beyond a previously approved withdrawal date . They would be responsible for helping the Iraqi navy protect oil installations off the southern coast . Moqtada al-Sadr has been a vocal and influential critic of the foreign military presence in Iraq , led by the United States . U.S. troops withdrew from Iraqi cities at the end of June , transferring security responsibilities to Iraqi forces . Since then , there have been a several deadly bombings across the country . A car bomb Saturday in a Shi'ite district near Mosul killed four people and wounded at least 35 others . Chinese National Basketball Association All-Star center Yao Ming will be on the sidelines for several games because of a sore right big toe . The Houston Rockets star missed his first game of the season and the third of his NBA career on Sunday . Witnesses say the Ethiopian troops returned heavy fire and that several people were wounded in the fighting . Exports of apparel have boomed in recent years primarily due to duty-free access to the US . Team officials say the injury will keep Yao off the court indefinitely .

Officials say they also issued 114 expulsion orders as part of the same operation . The raids focused on Islamic gathering places , including telephone call centers , Internet cafes and offices for sending cash abroad . However , Madagascar 's failure to comply with the requirements of the African Growth and Opportunity Act ( AGOA ) led to the termination of the country 's duty-free access in January 2010 . Officers also raided 15 apartments , mostly those of Pakistanis , in cooperation with a Belgian police investigation into suspected financing of terrorist groups . The raids , Thursday and Friday , followed Thursday 's arrest in Britain of 24 people suspected in an alleged plot to blow up U.S.-bound airliners over the Atlantic Ocean . Tens of thousands of anti-government demonstrators have marched on the main government offices in Thailand 's capital , Bangkok . Some 30,000 protesters marched through the city for two hours , urging the government to dissolve parliament and punish those responsible for last year 's crippling protests . The earlier demonstrations ousted current Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva 's pro-Thaksin predecessor Somchai Wongsawat . Before dispersing , the demonstrators promised to make their protest permanent , if their demands are not met within 15 days . More than 5,000 police were deployed to secure the mass protest , which ran from Saturday afternoon into early Sunday . Last year , yellow-shirted protesters occupied Government House for about three months , and shut down major airports before a coup ousted the government . Thailand has been wracked by political unrest for years . The country is sharply divided between groups who favor and oppose Mr. Thaksin , who was ousted in a coup in 2006 .

The agency said it took a photo of a pair of galaxies and that it \" scored a perfect 10 \" . The photo shows the ring-shaped galaxies just after they collided . The Hubble stopped beaming information to Earth in late September when a data unit failed . The computer glitch forced NASA to postpone a shuttle mission to repair the Hubble . That mission has been rescheduled for next year . Former President RAVALOMANANA worked aggressively to revive the economy following the 2002 political crisis , which triggered a 12 % drop in GDP that year . The Hubble has been orbiting about 600 kilometers above the Earth since 1990 . The telescope sends images from space back to Earth and has revolutionized understanding of the universe . Armed militants briefly occupied the West Bank headquarters of the Palestinian Cabinet Thursday , in a protest against the territory 's new Hamas-led government .

A Palestinian court has sentenced a man to death by hanging for selling West Bank land to Israeli citizens . The sentence was handed down Tuesday by a court in the West Bank town of Hebron , but it may be unlikely to be carried out . Prosecutors say the defendant sold to Israelis land that did not belong to him in the village of Beit Omar near Hebron . The Palestinian Authority considers the sale of Palestinian land to Israelis to be treason . Settled by both Britain and France during the first half of the 19th century , the island was made a French possession in 1853 . Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas must approve the sentence for it to be carried out . He has withheld approval in many other death penalty cases .

Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said interest rate policies and efforts to stimulate the faltering U.S. economy are \" well positioned \" to promote growth and stable prices . The Fed has been cutting interest rates steadily to boost economic growth . It served as a penal colony for four decades after 1864 . But officials must balance the need to boost the economy with the concern that cutting interest rates too low could spark inflation . Inflation concerns have been rising along with the price of oil . Fuel price hikes are also forcing the biggest U.S. automaker to slash truck production and make more small , fuel-efficient cars . General Motors Tuesday announced that it will close four North American plants that make trucks . Russian authorities have detained a man suspected of being involved in the deadly school siege in the southern town of Beslan . Officials in Moscow Wednesday said the man was arrested by security forces in Ingushetia , near the North Ossetia region where the attack took place .

Red Cross officials in Kabul say suspects detained by U.S. troops in Afghanistan have been allowed to speak with family members through a new video-teleconference system . Agitation for independence during the 1980s and early 1990s ended in the 1998 Noumea Accord , which over a period of 15 to 20 years will transfer an increasing amount of governing responsibility from France to New Caledonia . Officials said Monday , that about 60 families have so far taken advantage of the opportunity to speak with prisoners held at the detention center on the U.S. Bagram Air Force Base . Many families have not spoken to their detained relatives for several years . Around 600 detainees are being held at the facility .

The leader of the Republican majority in the Senate , Bill Frist , plans to bring to the Senate floor Mr. Bush 's nomination of Priscilla Owen . A Texas Supreme Court justice , Ms. Owen was one of seven nominees blocked by Democrats during the president 's first term . If Democrats are successful again , Republicans say they will seek early next week to change Senate rules to limit filibusters , a parliamentary delaying procedure aimed at preventing a vote . Opposition Democrats say changing Senate rules would drastically curtail the rights of the minority . The agreement also commits France to conduct a referendum between 2014 and 2019 to decide whether New Caledonia should assume full sovereignty and independence . Talks seeking a compromise have not been successful . The largest Sunni bloc in Iraq 's parliament has suspended its participation in the government and is threatening to withdraw completely . The Accordance Front Wednesday , gave Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki one week to meet its demands to deal with Shi'ite militias and reform the conduct of raids and arrests .

The world 's largest maker of jetliners , Airbus , says it sold more planes than rival Boeing last year . Tuesday 's announcement surprised some analysts who thought Boeing might regain the sales lead . Ethiopia deployed soldiers to Somalia last December to help the interim government push an Islamist movement from power . ALL the Goods were once driven out by the Ills from that common share which they each had in the affairs of mankind ; for the Ills by reason of their numbers had prevailed to possess the earth . Airbus says it has firm orders for a record 1055 planes , while Boeing has orders for 1002 , which is a record for the company . Boeing 's orders include more wide-body planes , so at list prices , its orders are worth somewhat more than Airbus . Orders for jetliners soared in 2005 , as Asian airlines expanded their fleets to meet growing demand , and other airlines sought new , more fuel-efficient planes to cope with high oil costs . U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates is in Pakistan to discuss counter-terrorism efforts and the Taleban insurgency in neighboring Afghanistan . Gates arrived in the capital , Islamabad , Monday to meet with Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf .

Bikindi was arrested in the Netherlands in 2001 . A police chief in western Iraq says the country began stationing thousands of extra security officers along Iraq 's border with Syria this week in an effort to keep out insurgents . The chief , Major-General Tariq Youssef , said Friday that Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki ordered the reinforcements , in the wake of August truck bombings in Baghdad that killed more than 100 people . The Iraqi government has linked the blasts to Baathist sympathizers located in Syria . Syria has demanded Iraqi authorities provide evidence to back up their allegations . Iraq has also demanded that Syria hand over two people that Baghdad suspects played a role in the attacks . They entreated Jupiter that they might no longer be associated with the Ills , as they had nothing in common and could not live together , but were engaged in unceasing warfare ; and that an indissoluble law might be laid down for their future protection . Syria has refused , demanding proof . The bombings have soured relations between Iraq and Syria . Turkey has been holding talks aimed at defusing tensions between the two countries . Venezuelan officials say they are investigating allegations that military officers passed state secrets to the United States .

The U.S. embassy in Caracas had no comment . An Israeli newspaper reports the filmmaker whose documentary sparked an outrage in Egypt has admitted that he mistakenly identified 250 Palestinian fighters as Egyptian prisoners , who he claimed were killed by Israeli troops during the 1967 Six-Day War . Jupiter granted their request and decreed that henceforth the Ills should visit the earth in company with each other , but that the Goods should one by one enter the habitations of men . The Jerusalem Post says the filmmaker Ran Edelist also admitted using incorrect archival footage to illustrate the incident . Since the documentary was aired last week , Israel repeatedly denied that its soldiers killed Egyptian prisoners during the war . Israel also agreed to hand over a copy of the film and its transcript to Egypt . However , Egypt asked for an investigation . And , an Egyptian parliamentary committee has threatened to review economic relations and agreements with Israel if the incident is not investigated . Because of rising tensions over the film , Israeli Cabinet Minister Benjamin Ben-Eliezer earlier this week postponed a scheduled visit to Egypt . Ben-Eliezer commanded the military unit at the center of the controversy . U.S. Olympic Committee chairman Peter Ueberroth is calling on the U.S. government to reverse a decision to deny Cuba 's national baseball team permission to play in the United States . Last week , the Treasury Department denied a permit for Cuba to play in the inaugural 16-team World Baseball Classic in March . Ueberroth says the decision will damage American efforts to host the Olympics in the future . Hence it arises that Ills abound , for they come not one by one , but in troops , and by no means singly : while the Goods proceed from Jupiter , and are given , not alike to all , but singly , and separately ; and one by one to those who are able to discern them . Olympic host countries must guarantee all nations can participate . Cuba had been set to play against Puerto Rico , Panama and the Netherlands in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico in the first round . A permit from the Treasury Department 's Office of Foreign Assets Control is necessary because of U.S. laws governing certain commercial transactions with the communist island nation .

Belgium became independent from the Netherlands in 1830 ; it was occupied by Germany during World Wars I and II . The country prospered in the past half century as a modern , technologically advanced European state and member of NATO and the EU . Tensions between the Dutch-speaking Flemings of the north and the French-speaking Walloons of the south have led in recent years to constitutional amendments granting these regions formal recognition and autonomy . Turkmenistan is largely a desert country with intensive agriculture in irrigated oases and sizeable gas and oil resources . Also removed were A.J. Tabaldo and Leslie Hunt , who both sang Nina Simone 's \" Feeling Good \" . The two largest crops are cotton , most of which is produced for export , and wheat , which is domestically consumed . Although agriculture accounts for roughly 10 % of GDP , it continues to employ nearly half of the country 's workforce . With an authoritarian ex-Communist regime in power and a tribally based social structure , Turkmenistan has taken a cautious approach to economic reform , hoping to use gas and cotton export revenues to sustain its inefficient economy . Privatization goals remain limited . From 1998 - 2005 , Turkmenistan suffered from the continued lack of adequate export routes for natural gas and from obligations on extensive short-term external debt . At the same time , however , total exports rose by an average of roughly 15 % per year from 2003 - 8 , largely because of higher international oil and gas prices . New pipelines to China and Iran , that began operation in early 2010 , have given Turkmenistan additional export routes for its gas , although these new routes have not offset the sharp drop in export revenue since early 2009 from decreased gas exports to Russia . Overall prospects in the near future are discouraging because of widespread internal poverty , endemic corruption , a poor educational system , government misuse of oil and gas revenues , and Ashgabat 's reluctance to adopt market-oriented reforms . In the past , Turkmenistan 's economic statistics were state secrets . The new government has established a State Agency for Statistics , but GDP numbers and other figures are subject to wide margins of error . Still in the race , however , is 20-year-old New Jersey native Antonella Barba , whose racy photos have become an Internet sensation . In particular , the rate of GDP growth is uncertain .

Some African heads of state plan to push for a united continent during an African Union summit that begins Sunday in the Ghanaian capital of Accra . The three-day summit agenda is almost entirely dedicated to the idea of a United States of Africa . Proponents of the plan argue that a united federation of African nations could exercise more influence and better address problems facing the world 's poorest continent .

A government-run newspaper , New Light of Myanmar , says 5,588 prisoners have been freed on humanitarian grounds to coincide with the holiday . Monday 's gesture differs from three previous mass releases , which were conducted because of what the junta described as irregularities in arrests by the now dismantled National Intelligence bureau . The bureau 's former chief , former prime minister Khin Nyunt , has been placed under house arrest on accusations of corruption . The government has released nearly 20,000 prisoners since early November . Although about 50 dissidents were freed in prior releases , there was no indication that any political prisoners were let go this time . Human Rights Watch says a climate of fear threatens the Democratic Republic of Congo 's first elections in 40 years . The New York-based rights group says there was an increase in the number of attacks and detentions of journalists , human rights defenders and members of the political opposition in April and May . Human Rights Watch said Congolese authorities have failed to provide protection to the groups , and charged that security forces were involved in some of the attacks . Friday , his former interior minister , Yuri Kravchenko , apparently committed suicide hours before he was to be questioned in the case . The rights group urged a U.N. Security Council delegation set to visit the DRC Sunday to speak out against the intimidation . It said the elections , set for July 30 , can not be free and fair if the press and civil society are too afraid to speak out or engage in legitimate political debate . The DRC has been struggling to recover from a five-year civil war that left an estimated four million people dead . A moderate earthquake has sent people running away from the coastline of Indonesia 's Sulawesi island , less than a week after a powerful quake off Java island generated a tsunami that killed nearly 700 people . The latest quake , of 6.1 magnitude , struck deep under the waters of Tomini Bay off northern Sulawesi 's Gorontalo province Sunday . Fears of a tsunami proved unfounded , however , and there are no reports of damage or injuries . Japanese and U.S. monitoring agencies in the Pacific Ocean did not issue a tsunami warning after the quake . A powerful earthquake off the coast of Java last Monday generated a crushing wave that barreled through homes , restaurants and hotels in the Pangandaran area . Indonesian officials say the death toll from that tsunami has climbed to at least 668 . Thousands of prisoners in Kenya reportedly volunteered to skip lunch on New Year 's day so that the food could be sent to those suffering from famine . U.S. first lady Laura Bush has visited a center for missing children and praised the work of those trying to reunite the families separated by Hurricane Katrina . They skipped the meal after President Mwai Kibaki declared Kenya 's famine a national disaster and asked for more than $ 150 million in relief aid . Inadequate rainfall during Kenya 's rainy season has caused crop failure and the depletion of livestock herds . President Kibaki said in his New Year 's address that nearly one in 10 Kenyans will need famine relief for the next six months . At least 20 people and thousands of livestock have died as a result of the drought and famine . President Bush is expected to nominate one of his closest friends , Karen Hughes , to lead a State Department effort to improve the reputation of the United States among Muslims in the Arab world . The 48-year-old Ms. Hughes is expected to be nominated next week as Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs , a position that requires Senate confirmation . Ms. Hughes will join Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in leading the president 's push for democracy in the Middle East . Ms. Hughes has been one of President Bush 's closest advisors since he became the governor of Texas 10 years ago . The position of Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy has been vacant since last June when Margaret Tutwiler resigned after only six months on the job . A Burmese aid group says Burma 's military government has launched a new offensive along the country 's eastern border with Thailand . Mrs. Bush greeted volunteers at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children outside Washington Friday . The Free Burma Rangers says Burmese forces have displaced thousands of villagers in Karen state , burning their homes and rice crops . The group says nearly 5000 villagers are hiding in jungle and mountain areas of Burma . The U.S. Campaign for Burma last week reported similar attacks . The human right group said the attacks were aimed at bringing eastern Burma , which has historically been under control of Burma 's ethnic minorities , under the control of the country 's military government . Rights groups say more than 5,00,000 villagers are believed to have been forced from their homes in eastern Burma over the past decade . Spanish authorities say firefighters are making progress against wildfires that have scorched large parts of the Canary Islands . Officials said Wednesday the fires on the main islands of Tenerife and Gran Canaria had \" stabilized \" as winds eased and temperatures moderated . Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero inspected the damage and promised special government aid . Authorities say a quarter of the forests on both islands have been incinerated , along with habitats of rare plants and animals . The blazes have not reached coastal resorts popular with European tourists . The center in Alexandria , Virginia says more than 2,000 children are still reported missing from the hurricane or are looking for their parents or other caregivers . Environmentalists call the fires a catastrophe . About 9,000 people were in emergency shelters on Tenerife Wednesday , while most of the 5,000 displaced people on Gran Canaria have begun returning home . Tenerife authorities say they suspect arsonists started the wildfire on the island . Police on Gran Canaria are holding a forest worker who confessed to starting a fire there last Friday . A group of prominent political religious and business figures , led by former Czech President Vaclav Havel , has criticized Russia 's handling of a separatist rebellion in Chechnya . A letter by the group Wednesday accuses Russian President Vladimir Putin of using the war in Chechnya to take away people 's freedoms and re-establish an autocracy . In addition to Havel , the authors of the letter include former Irish President Mary Robinson , retired South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu , and billionaire George Soros . The letter appeared in a Prague newspaper , the Mlada Fronta Dnes , Wednesday as the Russian leader was due to begin a visit to the Czech capital . Russian troops battled separatist rebels in Chechnya for several years in the 1990s , but the fighting has subsided in recent years with pro-Russian forces controlling much of the republic . Cuban President Raul Castro says the ruling Communist Party will hold a congress in April , the first party congress to be held in Cuba since 1997 . Photographs and information of the missing , including adults , are posted on the center 's website . Mr. Castro said the island 's leaders will meet to chart a new economic future for the country . He made the announcement after meeting Monday with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez . There has been intense speculation that Fidel Castro 's future might be discussed at the next Communist Party congress , but Raul Castro did not mention his brother Monday . Fidel Castro , 84 , stepped down as president of Cuba in 2006 , but remains head of the Communist Party . Vatican officials say Pope John Paul II is getting nutrition through a nasal tube to boost his calorie intake and help what they call his \" slow and progressive \" recovery from throat surgery . A Vatican spokesman said the pontiff spends many hours in an armchair , celebrates Mass and works in contact with his aides in directly following church activities . He issued the statement shortly after the 84-year-old pontiff appeared at his window overlooking Saint Peter 's Square Wednesday , to bless the faithful . The crowd greeted the pope with cheers and applause when he raised his hand to bless them . But he was unable to speak when an aide put a microphone in front of him . The Vatican statement was the first official medical report on the pope since March 10 , three days before he was discharged from a hospital following a tracheotomy . Some children are only listed by their first name , as their full identification is still unknown , nearly three weeks after the storm hit . A group of Palestinian gunmen have briefly seized Bethelehem city hall in the West Bank , apparently demanding financial assistance from the Palestinian Authority . About 20 gunmen appeared on the roof of the city hall Tuesday , ordered all workers out and threatened to open fire . Palestinian police sealed off the streets leading to the building on Manger Square , near the Church of the Nativity . Officials say the gunmen were linked to the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades militant faction of the ruling Fatah movement of Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas . They were demanding money for about 300 members . The gunmen left the building after about an hour , following talks with the governor of Bethlehem . It was not immediately clear how the standoff was resolved . The incident is another sign of growing turmoil within the Palestinian territories ahead of a January parliamentary election . Pakistani officials say five militants , including suicide bombers , have been killed while trying to enter a military training area in the country 's northwest . Authorities say security forces opened fire on the attackers Tuesday as they tried to infiltrate the training center in the town of Mardan , near the Afghan border . The American Red Cross also has a registry of the missing . Officials say three suicide bombers detonated their explosives during the gunbattle , while two other militants were killed by troops . Four soldiers were wounded in the attack . There was no immediate claim of responsibility , but Taliban militants have carried out attacks in the area in the past . Russian President Vladimir Putin says the Kremlin 's opposition to independence for Kosovo is based on international law and a desire for regional stability . Mr. Putin said during talks with Serbian President Boris Tadic Sunday that Russia 's position is not based on what he calls ethnic or historical considerations . Mr. Tadic repeated Serbia 's opposition to an independent Kosovo , but said he is willing to compromise . Kosovo is an ethnic Albanian majority province of Serbia . The United Nations Security Council is considering a draft resolution that backs a U.N. envoy 's plan for supervised independence for the region . Russia , a traditional Serbian ally , has hinted it would veto the resolution . Kosovo has been under U.N. supervision since 1999 , when NATO airstrikes drove out Serbian and Yugoslav forces waging violence against the ethnic Albanians . Former president Jimmy Carter says the U.S. military should close its detention camp at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , following allegations of prisoner abuse . South Korea and China have canceled meetings with top Japanese officials to protest Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi 's visit to a controversial war shrine . South Korean Foreign Minister Ban Ki-moon said Wednesday he had called off a trip to Japan , saying the visit would not be \" appropriate . \" Officials in Seoul also say President Roh Moo-hyun may cancel a summit with Mr. Koizumi , expected to take place later this year . Tuesday , China canceled a trip to Beijing by Japan 's foreign minister , saying the visit was not timely given the current situation . The Yasukuni shrine honors 2.5 million Japanese war dead , including convicted war criminals . Critics say Yasukuni represents Japan 's past military aggression , but Mr. Koizumi says his visits are to pray for peace . President Bush says sanctions are a \" real possibility \" against Iran for its controversial nuclear program . Interviewed Friday on the CBS television network , Mr. Bush said a free world can not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon . Mr. Bush said he is open to all possible options for dealing with Iran , including military intervention . But he said that would be the last option . Mr. Carter told an audience in Atlanta Tuesday that closing the camp and several other secret detention centers around the globe would show that the United States is committed to defending human rights . In Tehran , the chief of Iran 's Revolutionary Guards , General Yahya Rahim Safavi , said Saturday his country would use ballistic missiles to defend itself if attacked . On Friday , the U.S. Senate voted unanimously to condemn Iran 's nuclear program , and to support referring Tehran to the United Nations Security Council for allegedly violating the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . The International Atomic Energy Agency meets February 2 in Vienna to discuss the Iran nuclear standoff . A brief gunbattle between rival Fatah factions erupted outside the Gaza headquarters of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas Wednesday , as the ruling party prepared to register its list of candidates for January 's parlimentary elections . Witnesses say at least three people were wounded . The clash occurred after Fatah gunmen stormed the building demanding that the party respect the results of recent primary elections . Mr. Abbas has decided to appoint candidates after canceling the results of the primaries in Gaza and some other areas where balloting was marred by violence and fraud . Some hard-liners fear they will not be properly represented in the Fatah list . On Tuesday , a flare-up of election-related violence in Gaza forced Palestinian election officials to close their offices in the there and in the West Bank . The offices are to open later today . He did not elaborate on why negotiators had come to the decision . Earlier this week , a leading Democrat in the Senate called on President Bush to shut down the Guantanamo camp and launch a massive probe into alleged abuses there . Mr. Abbas has been struggling to contain internal unrest since Israel pulled out of Gaza in September . U.S. troops and Iraqi security forces have detained 49 suspected insurgents north of Baghdad , as operations continue to secure the country ahead of January 's election . The U.S. military says the pre-dawn raid Friday was in the town of Duluiyah , in the insurgent-plagued Sunni Triangle north and west of Baghdad . Meanwhile , in Baghdad , firefighters extinguished a blaze at the city 's main oil refinery , which was attacked by saboteurs late Thursday . Also Friday , near Fallujah , the body of an Iraqi National Guardsman was found with a note warning others against working with U.S.-led forces . Iraq 's security forces have been the main target of insurgent violence . And South Korea 's parliament overwhelmingly approved keeping its 3,600 troops in northern Iraq for another year . Pope Benedict has met with the parents of the four-year-old British girl who disappeared from a tourist resort in Portugal in early May . The pope Wednesday spoke to Gerry and Kate McCann following his weekly audience in St. Peter 's Square . The pontiff blessed a photograph of their daughter , Madeleine , who disappeared when the parents left her and two siblings in a resort hotel while they went to dinner . A report by the human rights group Amnesty International criticizes the U.S. military for holding terrorist suspects without charge and for other abuses . Kate McCann said the pope told her he would continue to pray for Madeleine 's safe return . The couple are devout Catholics , but Gerry McCann said he had conflicting emotions about meeting the pope because of the circumstances . The McCann 's are also planning to travel to Spain and Germany in their continued campaign to publicize their daughter 's disappearance . A public outcry in Britain and Portugal at the apparent abduction of young Madeleine has prompted politicians and celebrities to offer their support . A leading human rights group is criticizing what it calls the refusal by the United States and other western countries to intervene in Sudan 's troubled Darfur region . In its annual report , Human Rights Watch says western countries are wrong to leave peacekeeping duties in Darfur to the African Union , which the group calls a new institution with no peacekeeping experience . Last year , the African Union began sending peacekeepers to Darfur , where two years of fighting between rebels and government-backed militias have claimed an estimated 70,000 lives . On another issue , the HRW report says the abuse of prisoners by U.S. soldiers at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq weakened the worldwide system for protecting human rights . The report also condemns attacks on the rights of sexual minorities around the world . The Supreme Court of Pakistan has given the country 's election commission 30 days to register all eligible voters left out of draft electoral lists . Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has rejected the Amnesty report as \" absurd , \" and he says U.S. officials have no plans to close the camp at Guantanamo . The petition was filed by former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and her opposition Pakistan People 's Party . It contends that more than 20 million eligible voters had not been enrolled . At a hearing Friday , the election commission requested 140 days to prepare the revised lists . The two-member bench rejected the request , saying the time period was too long . The court instead granted the commission 30 days to make the necessary changes . The decision comes a day after Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf decided against declaring a state of emergency that could have delayed elections for a year . British diplomat John Sawers says Iran presented no major new proposals at Monday 's last-ditch talks aimed at resolving the standoff over Iran 's nuclear program . But Iran 's negotiator Javad Vaeedi described the session with Britain , Germany and France in Brussels as positive . The talks came before Monday 's meeting in London of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany on Iran 's nuclear program . President Bush , speaking at the White House , said there is an international consensus that Iran should not be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon . NATO says it is investigating allegations that seven members of a private security company were killed Saturday during an Afghan and coalition force operation . He says U.S. and other officials are working on how to go about achieving that goal . Later this week , the International Atomic Energy Agency holds an emergency session that could see Iran referred to the U.N. Security Council for possible sanctions . The U.S. unemployment rate fell unexpectedly in July , in one of the strongest signals yet that the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression may be ending . A report from the Labor Department Friday shows the unemployment rate dropped to 9.4 percent last month , compared to 9.5 percent in June . It is the first time the jobless rate has fallen since April 2008 . Employers cut 2,47,000 jobs in July . The number is much less than analysts had expected , but still an indication of a weak job market . In total , about 14.5 million people are unemployed in the United States . President Barack Obama has said the $ 787 billion economic stimulus plan he signed within months of taking office has stopped the recession from getting worse . Chinese President Hu Jintao is calling for closer economic and cultural relations with Taiwan to maintain peace in the region , and to curb what he calls the island 's \" secessionist activities . \" A coalition statement says the deadly shooting happened after its service members had \" peacefully detained \" a Haqqani facilitator in Paktiya province . China 's official Xinhua news agency says Mr. Hu made the comments Saturday in Beijing at a forum on China and Taiwan business ties . Xinhua says that during the forum , the Chinese leader met with the honorary chairman of Taiwan 's main opposition party , Lien Chan . About 500 participants are attending the two-day event . They are expected to discuss issues including direct flights from Taiwan to the mainland . Taiwan and China split in 1949 following a civil war . But Beijing still considers the island as part of its territory and has threatened to use force if necessary to reunite the two sides . The man who has been guiding the U.S. economy for the past 18 years , Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan , is set to retire at the end of January . The head of the U.S. central bank is highly regarded by economists , markets and political leaders . President Bush has given no indication who he is considering to replace Mr. Greenspan or when his decision will be announced . News reports speculate that the chairman of Mr. Bush 's Council of Economic Advisors , Ben Bernanke , is the leading candidate . NATO says after the joint force used a bullhorn to call for occupants of a vehicle to \" exit peacefully , \" a man got out of the vehicle with an AK-47 . He is a monetary economist and a former member of the key Fed committee that sets interest rates . Other candidates include academic economists with policy experience like Glenn Hubbard and Martin Feldstein . Venezuela says a bomb attack has killed Deputy Attorney General Danilo Anderson . Officials told VOA Friday the charred body has been positively identified as that of Mr. Anderson , who was killed around midnight Thursday as he drove through a suburb of Caracas . Mr. Anderson had been in charge of prosecuting several hundred politicians , businessmen and former military officers involved in a failed April 2002 coup that briefly ousted President Hugo Chavez . Officials say President Chavez has canceled his trip to Costa Rica Friday to attend the Ibero-American summit . They say he has also canceled a two-week tour of Spain , Iran , Libya and Russia that was to begin this weekend . The price of crude oil soared Tuesday , hitting a new record high above $ 119 a barrel in New York trading . The price of crude oil for future delivery went to $ 119.48 cents a barrel . Traders say a tight balance between demand and supply means oil prices jump when supplies seem threatened or demand rises . The alliance says the security force assessed the man \" to be hostile \" and shot him . Currently supply concerns are growing out of violence in Nigeria , reports that Russia will produce less oil this year , and a possible strike by Scottish refinery workers . The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries says it will boost its current 32-million-barrel-a-day output by a bit more than one quarter by the year 2020 . That will help meet growing demand in the long term but has little effect on oil prices right now . OPEC officials say there is sufficient oil on the market and blames rising prices on speculators and the falling U.S. dollar . Three people have been rescued after a tunnel allegedly used by Palestinian weapons smugglers collapsed . Israel says a joint Israeli army and Palestinian operation succeeded in reaching the men , several hours after the tunnel along the border between the Gaza Strip and Egypt fell in . The incident happened in the same area where Israeli soldiers shot and killed three Egyptian police officers Thursday . The Israeli army says a tank crew mistook the Egyptians for Palestinian militants and opened fire . Egypt has condemned the killings . The Israeli army has expressed its regret . NATO says several armed individuals then clashed with the force , resulting in seven deaths . Israeli officials also apologized and opened an investigation . European Union regulators have fined Microsoft Corporation $ 357 million for failing to share programming code with its rivals , as demanded by a 2004 antitrust ruling . The EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes says Microsoft is continuing its illegal conduct , and no company is above the law . The fine was assessed at a rate of nearly $ 2 million a day from December 16 through June 20 . EU officials say Microsoft 's daily fines will double ( to $ 3.8 million ) at the end of this month if the company 's violations continue . The European Union fined Microsoft $ 633 million in 2004 and ordered the company to give its rivals the technical information necessary for their programs to operate smoothly on computers using Microsoft 's Windows operating system . Microsoft has said it has 300 people working full time to comply with the EU 's orders , and that any additional fines would be unjustified . Icy rain and snow brought down a major power line in Moscow , shutting down the city 's main airport and snarling traffic on its busy streets . Officials said on Sunday that flights from the Domodedovo airport were suspended for almost 15 hours until the power was partially restored and some planes were allowed to take off . Flights from Moscow 's second airport , Sheremetyevo , were operating , but travelers experienced delays . NATO says it is assessing who the individuals were . Roughly 2,00,000 people were left without power as ice snapped power lines and slicked over the capital 's streets and encased cars . According to Russia 's state-owned news agency , Ria Novosti , some 6,000 passengers were stranded at Domodedovo , and taxis were charging more than $ 300 to take clients to the airport . Officials warned residents to stay home until conditions improved . The United Nations says in the past year more than one million people contracted HIV infections in South Asia , and the disease is spreading largely due to drug use and unsafe sex . In its annual report on the global AIDS epidemic , the world body says the spread of HIV is stabilizing in some of India 's states , but overall it is still rising . India already has an estimated 5.1 million HIV-positive people . According to the report , some 42 percent of female sex workers in India say they are able to guess if their clients are HIV positive because of their physical appearance . But the report says ignorance about the disease is serious elsewhere in South Asia . Citing Pakistan as an example , the report says one in every five female sex workers in the largest city of Karachi can not recognize a condom , and one-third never heard of AIDS . Israel has agreed to free 170 Palestinian prisoners . Brazilian security forces , backed by tanks and helicopters , have carried out an operation to recover stolen weapons from a slum in Rio de Janeiro . The release is part of a promise Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon made to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to secure the release this month of an Israeli jailed by Egypt on espionage charges . Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon called Sunday 's decision a goodwill gesture toward the Egyptian leader . The Palestinians are expected to be freed in the next week . The prisoners ' identities were not immediately known , but Israel has said it would not release those it said had \" blood on their hands . \" Palestinian officials have long demanded the release of thousands of prisoners held by Israel . They have also criticized previous prisoner releases as inadequate . The U.S. secretary of the interior said he will not change a Bush administration rule on protection of polar bears , despite pressure from environmentalists . Ken Salazar announced Friday that a special rule applying to polar bears , under the Endangered Species Act , can only restrict dangers to the bears that originate in the bears ' northern habitat . That rules out application of the rule to carbon emissions farther south , even though they can affect the Arctic climate where the bears live . Salazar said the Endangered Species Act was not the \" proper mechanism \" for dealing with climate change and said a more comprehensive strategy is needed . Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas resumed U.S.-brokered peace talks last November , but progress has been slow . More than 1,000 soldiers and police officers searched Monday for 10 assault rifles and a nine-millimeter pistol stolen from army barracks by a group of armed men on Friday . Environmentalists criticized the decision as threatening to the polar bear population . Polar bears have been a touchstone in discussions on climate change because they rely on sea ice , which scientists say is melting as the planet 's atmosphere warms . Police in southwest Pakistan say gunmen have shot and killed the government spokesman in southwestern Balochistan province . Local officers say that Raziq Bugti died at the scene after unidentified assailants fired a barrage of shots into his vehicle as it traveled through the provincial capital , Quetta . Bugti served as the spokesman for the provincial government and advisor to the chief minister . In May , Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf said that government forces have wiped out nearly all separatist camps in the gas-rich province . Nationalist rebels have been fighting for decades for a larger share of the profits from the resources of Balochistan , Pakistan 's biggest province . Hundreds of people have been killed in separatist attacks on gas , transport and other energy facilities . Nigeria has rejected as unfair a new corruption index which says the oil-rich nation is seen as the most corrupt on the African continent . In a statement , Nigeria 's Information Ministry said the index by Berlin-based group Transparency International failed to recognize the government 's efforts at fighting graft . A homemade bomb was hurled at soldiers at the entrance of the Providencia slum in the early hours of Monday morning . It accused the group of using faulty and outdated information in its annual ranking of 146 nations based on perceived corruption . Nigerian officials also say the index focuses on governments taking bribes , but ignores western companies blamed for offering illegal payments . The index lists Nigeria ahead of only Bangladesh and Haiti as the most corrupt nations in the world . Transparency International says corruption is often high among other oil-producing nations as well , including Angola , Chad , Libya and Sudan . Afghanistan 's Interior Ministry says roadside bomb blasts in southern Helmand province have killed six civilians . The Interior Ministry said the deaths occurred Saturday in two places after the victims drove over the devices . Meanwhile , a joint NATO-Afghan security force has killed several Taliban fighters in an operation in the northeast . NATO says one of the insurgents killed Saturday near Alasay Valley in Kapisa province , outside Kabul , is a suspected Taliban commander . He is believed to be responsible for violent attacks against Afghan government officials , as well as the joint forces . Officials say the insurgents are also suspected of imposing strict curfews on the villages in the valley and conducting illegal patrols to enforce Taliban control on local civilians . No injuries were reported . Multiple weapons , including a rocket-propelled grenade , were discovered during the operation . In southern Afghanistan , the British Defense Ministry said Saturday one of its soldiers was killed by a suicide blast . Croatia 's Janica Kostelic has won her first ever women 's World Cup giant slalom title in Spindleruv Mlyn , the Czech Republic .

Kostelic , the reigning Olympic giant slalom champion , had never won the event on the World Cup circuit before . Kostelic has won previously in World Cup slalom and combined events and claimed the world championships in the downhill , the slalom and the combined . A Ukrainian court has ruled the privatization of the country 's largest steel mill was illegal . A court in Kiev made the ruling Thursday regarding the Kryvorizhstal mill . Security officials say police and soldiers exchanged fire with slum residents . A consortium that included the son-in-law of former Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma purchased the complex in June for $ 800 million , far less than its estimated value . Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said Wednesday that some 3,000 privatizations will be reviewed to ensure they were conducted fairly . Meanwhile , Justice Minister Roman Zvarych is threatening to quit after less than two weeks on the job , citing efforts by businessmen to influence his ministry . He told Canal Five television he refuses to allow businessmen who are also deputies with oil ties to interfere with his work , and said he will not allow members of the government , who he did not name , drag his family into corruption schemes . Military forces of two Burmese ethnic groups engaged in intense fighting along the border with Thailand earlier this week . Sources say the fighting broke out Tuesday between forces aligned with the Wa and Shan groups near Thailand 's northern Mae Hong Son province . The battle began after talks to resolve several issues broke down , including a dispute over water use . There is also speculation that illegal drugs also played a part in the fighting . Thailand has increased security along the Burmese border to keep the violence from spilling over into its territories . The U.S. military says it has captured a number of key terrorist leaders in a series of operations aimed at weakening al-Qaida in Iraq . Rio is one of the world 's most violent cities . The military says its forces spread out across central and northern Iraq Thursday , detaining 25 suspected terrorists . Officials say one of the suspects is an alleged leader of an al-Qaida cell in Baghdad who was helping to bring foreign terrorists into Iraq . Forces also arrested a man thought to be senior al-Qaida leader in Mosul . In violence Wednesday , a suicide car bomber attacked an Iraqi army patrol in the northern city of Mosul , killing three people and wounding 14 others . In Baghdad , the military said a roadside bomb wounded three Iraqi civilians . The military also said Iraqi soldiers recovered Iranian-made rockets and other weapons in Baghdad 's Sadr City district on Monday . It said some of the Iranian munitions had a manufacture date of early 2008 . Pakistan 's Interior Ministry says gunmen have released all the children briefly held hostage at a high school in North West Frontier Province . Ministry spokesman Javed Cheema says the gunmen surrendered to the local jirga ( tribal council ) along with their weapons and released the children . The ministry said up to 250 students were being held . Its slums are often the scene of gang and drug-related violence that kills hundreds of people each year . The gunmen took refuge in the school after an aborted attempt to abduct a health official in a neighboring district . The official was eventually freed after clashes with police . Police then surrounded the building while tribesmen negotiated with the insurgents . Officials say the kidnappers had demanded safe passage in return for freeing the students . Violence has spread in recent months in areas of Pakistan near the border with Afghanistan , which are believed to be sanctuaries for al Qaeda and Taliban militants . The head of the World Health Organization says the world 's capacity for making enough swine flu vaccine for nearly seven billion people is \" woefully inadequate . \" Margaret Chan said at a Geneva conference Tuesday that almost everyone on the planet is susceptible to the H1N1 swine flu virus . But she said most of the limited supply of the vaccine will go to wealthy countries , calling it an example of life-saving intervention biased towards affluence . Chan called for more innovation in developing new medicines to ensure everyone gets the vaccine . WHO officials have said they believe the first mass vaccines will be available by September and that health care providers should get inoculated first . China has issued a new set of rules that state-media said would better protect religious freedoms in the officially atheist country . The latest WHO report confirms nearly 95,000 swine flu cases worldwide with 429 deaths . Political analysts say the results of some close elections across the United States could be delayed for days or weeks , as absentee and provisional ballots are counted . Many states have allowed voters to cast absentee ballots for weeks . Those votes , however , usually take longer to count , and a final tally of the results from those ballots could take days . Provisional ballots are often used when a voter is not registered at the polling place , who did not bring the proper type of identification or who shows up at the wrong voting precinct . In 2004 , the first year provisional ballots were used nationwide , about 1.9 million people cast them . More than 1.2 million of those votes were ruled valid . In the northwestern state of Washington in 2004 , provisional ballots played a role in delaying Democratic gubernatorial candidate Christine Gregoire 's victory for more than eight weeks . A massive winter storm is barreling across the central United States , causing mayhem on the roads and threatening to ruin many Americans ' Christmas holiday plans . The storm stretches as far north as Minnesota , along the Canadian border , to Texas in the south . The official Xinhua news agency said Sunday that the Religious Affairs Provisions explicitly specify the rights of religious groups , religious sites , and people . Freezing rain , snow and heavy winds are making driving conditions extremely dangerous in some states . The National Weather Service has issued a blizzard warning to remain in effect for many areas until Saturday , predicting up to 30 centimeters of snow in many northern locales . The warning says \" life-threatening \" weather conditions are expected and strongly discourages travel . Americans on the east coast are just recovering from a major storm last week that dropped as much as 60 centimeters of snow in some areas , and caused widespread power outages . A winter storm in the northeastern United States has shut down airline travel and cut power to thousands of people . U.S. weather forecasters said more than 50 centimeters of snow has fallen in some areas since Saturday , and more snow was expected through Sunday . Officials closed at least two major airports servicing New York City , and air traffic was disrupted at other key cities . Service resumed at Ronald Reagan National airport in Washington , which had closed earlier in the day .

In a speech last week , Cuban President Fidel Castro indicated pay increases may be needed to battle corruption . At the same time , Cuba announced a steep increase in utility rates for heavy users of electricity . The heavily subsidized rates Cubans now pay for the first 100 kilowatt hours will stay the same , but after that , rates increase to up to three times their former rates for the heaviest users . Granma , the Cuban Communist Party newspaper , said the increase was to encourage energy conservation among Cubans .

Lebanese soldiers have seized several buildings in a Palestinian refugee camp where they have been battling Islamic militants for two months . The Lebanese military says two soldiers were killed in Sunday 's fighting in the Nahr el-Bared camp near Tripoli . The ABC News-Washington Post survey published Wednesday found that just over half ( 53 percent ) of the 1,600 people surveyed said the war in Iraq is not worth fighting , while 57 percent disapprove of the president 's handling of the conflict . Witnesses say Lebanese flags were seen flying over buildings in the camp . The military also bombarded militants ' positions with artillery shells for a second day , as the militants fired rockets that hit fields outside the camp . More than 170 people , including at least 97 Lebanese soldiers , have been killed since the standoff began May 20th . Nearly all of the Palestinian refugees living in the camp have fled . Last month , Lebanese officials claimed victory in the fighting , but daily firefights have continued since then . The price of crude oil has fallen to its lowest level in more than 18 months as mild weather in the northern hemisphere has caused inventories to rise . Light sweet crude for February delivery Tuesday dropped as much as $ 2 a barrel to $ 53.88 . That is the lowest price per barrel in New York trading since June 2005 . The price drop comes despite the disruption of Russia 's oil exports to Europe . Moscow refuses to pay a newly imposed customs tax by Minsk for its oil crossing Belarus , which supplies 20 percent of Russian oil to Europe . The survey also said 73 percent disapprove of President Bush 's efforts to control the soaring gasoline prices in the United States . Oil also declined as traders expressed skepticism OPEC plans to cut oil production by another 5,00,000 barrels per day . The international oil cartel agreed to a production cut of one million barrels per day in November , but prices have continued to drop . The White House is hailing an upcoming Israeli-Palestinian summit in Egypt , calling it an encouraging step that shows both sides want to seize the opportunity for peace . The U.S. comments Wednesday followed announcements that Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon will meet new Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas and Jordan 's King Abdullah Tuesday in Sharm al-Sheikh .

Sources said Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal and Islamic Jihad leader Ramadan Shallah both met with Egyptian negotiators . Egyptian security forces have arrested at least 10 more members of the country 's largest opposition group , the Muslim Brotherhood . Thursday 's arrests come after 17 Brotherhood members were detained earlier this week . The Egyptian government is intensifying its crackdown on the banned Islamist political group . The poll said that Mr. Bush 's handing of the war against terrorism received 56 percent approval , the only issue on which he received a majority approval . The Brotherhood says the government campaign is a direct reaction to the group 's rejection of constitutional amendments proposed by President Hosni Mubarak . Officials of the Brotherhood say the amendments are aimed at giving the ruling party more power and barring Muslim Brothers from politics . The Brotherhood won a fifth of the seats in Egypt 's parliament by running members as independents in the 2005 elections , making it the largest opposition group . The constitutional amendments proposed by Mr. Mubarak would reduce the role of judges in monitoring elections and ban religious groups from forming political parties . The Brotherhood advocates an Islamic state , achieved through peaceful means . An Israeli security official says a top Hamas commander captured last week could be a \" bargaining chip \" to win the release of an Israeli soldier held for over a year . Public Security Minister Avi Dichter told Israeli Army Radio Monday that Hamas commander Mhawesh al-Qadi might be exchanged for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit . Israeli commandos dressed as Palestinian security forces abducted the Hamas commander in Gaza Strip in a raid on Friday . Shalit was captured by militant groups in Gaza in June 2006 . Hamas , which seized control of Gaza three months ago , has demanded the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the Israeli soldier .

Hallwood , a Cleveland merchant bank , owns about 11 % of Integra . Having a small , open economy makes Macedonia vulnerable to economic developments in Europe and dependent on regional integration and progress toward EU membership for continued economic growth . At independence in September 1991 , Macedonia was the least developed of the Yugoslav republics , producing a mere 5 % of the total federal output of goods and services . The collapse of Yugoslavia ended transfer payments from the central government and eliminated advantages from inclusion in a de~facto free trade area . An absence of infrastructure , UN sanctions on the downsized Yugoslavia , and a Greek economic embargo over a dispute about the country 's constitutional name and flag hindered economic growth until 1996 . Since then , Macedonia has maintained macroeconomic stability with low inflation , but it has so far lagged the region in attracting foreign investment and creating jobs , despite making extensive fiscal and business sector reforms . Official unemployment remains high at 31.7 % , but may be overstated based on the existence of an extensive gray market , estimated to be more than 20 % of GDP , that is not captured by official statistics . In the wake of the global economic downturn , Macedonia has experienced decreased foreign direct investment , lowered credit , and a large trade deficit . However , as a result of conservative fiscal policies and a sound financial system , in 2010 the country received slightly improved credit ratings . He told reporters in the West Bank that there is still room for progress in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations . One of the negotiators , Fuad Masoum , says there are further , important issues that need to be resolved before a government is formed . Macroeconomic stability also was maintained by a prudent monetary policy , which kept the domestic currency at the pegged level against the euro , while interest rates were falling . As a result , GDP growth was modest , but positive , in 2010 . In late 1999 , about 70 % of the economic infrastructure of Timor-Leste was laid waste by Indonesian troops and anti-independence militias . Three hundred thousand people fled westward . Over the next three years a massive international program , manned by 5,000 peacekeepers ( 8,000 at peak ) and 1,300 police officers , led to substantial reconstruction in both urban and rural areas . By the end of 2005 , refugees had returned or had settled in Indonesia . The country continues to face great challenges in rebuilding its infrastructure , strengthening the civil administration , and generating jobs for young people entering the work force . The development of oil and gas resources in offshore waters has greatly supplemented government revenues . This technology-intensive industry , however , has done little to create jobs for the unemployed because there are no production facilities in Timor-Leste . Gas is piped to Australia . Negotiators have been hoping to agree on a government before Iraq 's National Assembly convenes for the first time on Wednesday . In June 2005 , the National Parliament unanimously approved the creation of a Petroleum Fund to serve as a repository for all petroleum revenues and to preserve the value of Timor-Leste 's petroleum wealth for future generations . The Fund held assets of US $ 6.6 billion as of October 2010 . The economy continues to recover strongly from the mid-2006 outbreak of violence and civil unrest , which disrupted both private and public sector economic activity . The government in 2008 resettled tens of thousands of an estimated 1,00,000 internally displaced persons ( IDPs ) ; most IDPs returned home by early 2009 . Government spending increased markedly in 2009 and 2010 , primarily on basic infrastructure , including electricity and roads . Limited experience in procurement and infrastructure building has hampered these projects . The underlying economic policy challenge the country faces remains how best to use oil-and-gas wealth to lift the non-oil economy onto a higher growth path and to reduce poverty . Finland was a province and then a grand duchy under Sweden from the 12th to the 19th centuries , and an autonomous grand duchy of Russia after 1809 . It won its complete independence in 1917 . During World War II , it was able to successfully defend its freedom and resist invasions by the Soviet Union - albeit with some loss of territory .

A new public opinion poll indicates that Americans ' support for the war in Iraq is at its lowest ever - and that in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina , most Americans are concerned Iraq is draining money and resources needed at home . In a New York Times / CBS poll released Saturday , a record low number of those surveyed - only 44 percent - said the United States made the right decision in going to war in Iraq . Fifty-two percent wanted troops to be withdrawn as soon as possible , even if it means leaving the country unstable .

A prominent U.S. newspaper says Washington wants to expand a secret Central Intelligence Agency operation in Pakistan designed to eliminate Islamic militants ' havens near the Afghan border . It says it has received only slightly more than half of the $ 212 million it needs this year for food aid in Ethiopia . The agency says it has less than 20 percent of what it needs for non-food items such as health , water and sanitation facilities .

At least 35,000 people have rallied in Pakistan 's largest city , Karachi , to protest controversial cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad . Shouting anti-American and anti-European slogans , the demonstrators marched through the city to denounce the cartoons , first published in Denmark last September . A coalition of radical Islamic groups which opposes President Pervez Musharraf 's support for the U.S.-led war on terror organized Sunday 's rally . Hundreds of riot police closely watched the gathering but no violence was reported . The report says Islamabad has refused the requests for additional personnel because it remains \" extremely wary \" of a larger U.S. ground presence in Pakistan . Some protests in Pakistan have turned deadly and at least five people died in rioting last month . Iraqi officials say former dictator Saddam Hussein will go on trial in the second half of October , so as not to affect the outcome of a national referendum on the constitution to be held October 15 . No official announcement has come from the Iraqi Special Tribunal in charge of the trials , but officials close to the case said Friday that Saddam Hussein will be tried for the 1982 killing of dozens of residents of the town of Dujail .

Iran has not officially responded to a U.N.-backed uranium-enrichment proposal that was drafted three weeks ago in Vienna . But leading Iranian parliamentarian Alaeddin Boroujerdi Saturday indicated Tehran will reject the plan to send any of its 1,200 kilograms of enriched uranium abroad for further enrichment . The newspaper reports the number of CIA personnel in Pakistan is \" highly classified , \" but says it \" has grown substantially \" in recent years .

It also sets benchmarks for Iraq 's government to show progress in securing the country . The Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives approved a similar measure Wednesday . White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said President Bush will veto the legislation \" very soon \" after it arrives on his desk . The House measure lacked the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto , and the Senate measure is not expected to have enough votes to override a veto , either . The Senate bill includes some $ 95 billion to fund military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan through the end of September .

On Wednesday , a U.S. commander in eastern Afghanistan said an expected Taleban offensive has not materialized , partly because of increased operations by U.S. and NATO forces . Brigadier General Joseph Votel says there are clashes every day , but they are mostly small scale . U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson is warning against irresponsible borrowing or lending to countries that have recently received debt relief . Speaking in Singapore Monday to the World Bank 's policy-setting committee , Paulson said the organization should develop an approach that prevents a reemergence of debt distress .

Authorities say the accident occurred Saturday , near the town of Veligonda in southern Andhra Pradesh state . Mr. Lantos says the officials told him they support a resumption of the talks , but want to see the shape of President Bush 's second administration before making any commitments . However , Mr. Lantos says there is no reason for Pyongyang to expect a significant change in U.S. policy towards the Korean peninsula . North Korea has participated in three rounds of multi-party talks on its nuclear ambitions , but boycotted a fourth round scheduled for September because of what it called Washington 's hostile policy .

In 2008 , Liechtenstein came under renewed international pressure - particularly from Germany - to improve transparency in its banking and tax systems . In December 2008 , Liechtenstein signed a Tax Information Exchange Agreement with the US . Upon Liechtenstein 's conclusion of 12 bilateral information-sharing agreements , the OECD in October 2009 removed the principality from its \" grey list \" of countries that had yet to implement the organization 's Model Tax Convention . By the end of 2010 , Liechtenstein had signed 25 Tax Information Exchange Agreements or Double Tax Agreements . Uruguay 's economy is characterized by an export-oriented agricultural sector , a well-educated work force , and high levels of social spending . Following financial difficulties in the late 1990s and early 2000s , economic growth for Uruguay averaged 8 % annually during the period 2004 - 8 . The fine must be paid before Turkey can be readmitted to the sport 's International Federation , with the money to be used for anti-doping activities . The 2008 - 9 global financial crisis put a brake on Uruguay 's vigorous growth , which decelerated to 2.9 % in 2009 . Nevertheless , the country managed to avoid a recession and keep positive growth rates , mainly through higher public expenditure and investment , and GDP growth exceeded 8 % in 2010 . Since 1997 , Sudan has been working with the IMF to implement macroeconomic reforms including a managed float of the exchange rate and a large reserve of foreign exchange . A new currency , the Sudanese Pound , was introduced in January 2007 at an initial exchange rate of $ 1 equals 2 Sudanese Pounds . Sudan began exporting crude oil in the last quarter of 1999 and the economy boomed on the back of increases in oil production , high oil prices , and significant inflows of foreign direct investment until the second half of 2008 . The Darfur conflict , the aftermath of two decades of civil war in the south , the lack of basic infrastructure in large areas , and a reliance by much of the population on subsistence agriculture ensure much of the population will remain at or below the poverty line for years to come despite rapid rises in average per capita income . Sudan 's real GDP expanded by 5.2 % during 2010 , an improvement over 2009 's 4.2 % growth but significantly below the more than 10 % per year growth experienced prior to the global financial crisis in 2006 and 2007 . While the oil sector continues to drive growth , services and utilities play an increasingly important role in the economy with agriculture production remaining important as it employs 80 % of the work force and contributes a third of GDP . In the lead up to the referendum on southern secession , which took place in January 2011 , Sudan saw its currency depreciate considerably on the black market with the Central Bank 's official rate also losing value as the Sudanese people started to hoard foreign currency . The Central Bank of Sudan intervened heavily in the currency market to defend the value of the pound and the Sudanese government introduced a number of measures to restrain excess local demand for hard currency , but uncertainty about the secession has meant that foreign exchange remains in heavy demand . The IWF also directed the Turkish Federation to identify and sanction athletes and coaches involved in the violations , and develop an anti-doping education program to be approved and monitored by the world body 's executive board . The Swiss Confederation was founded in 1291 as a defensive alliance among three cantons . In succeeding years , other localities joined the original three . The Swiss Confederation secured its independence from the Holy Roman Empire in 1499 . A constitution of 1848 , subsequently modified in 1874 , replaced the confederation with a centralized federal government . Switzerland 's sovereignty and neutrality have long been honored by the major European powers , and the country was not involved in either of the two world wars . The political and economic integration of Europe over the past half century , as well as Switzerland 's role in many UN and international organizations , has strengthened Switzerland 's ties with its neighbors . However , the country did not officially become a UN member until 2002 . Switzerland remains active in many UN and international organizations but retains a strong commitment to neutrality . A CROW was jealous of the Raven , because he was considered a bird of good omen and always attracted the attention of men , who noted by his flight the good or evil course of future events . Seeing some travelers approaching , the Crow flew up into a tree , and perching herself on one of the branches , cawed as loudly as she could . Brazil 's president is pledging to invest at least $ 1.7 billion to develop Rio de Janeiro 's slums . The travelers turned towards the sound and wondered what it foreboded , when one of them said to his companion , \" Let us proceed on our journey , my friend , for it is only the caw of a crow , and her cry , you know , is no omen . \" Those who assume a character which does not belong to them , only make themselves ridiculous . A RICH MAN lived near a Tanner , and not being able to bear the unpleasant smell of the tan-yard , he pressed his neighbor to go away . The Tanner put off his departure from time to time , saying that he would leave soon . But as he still continued to stay , as time went on , the rich man became accustomed to the smell , and feeling no manner of inconvenience , made no further complaints . A FARMER who had a deadly and implacable hatred against a certain Fox , caught him and tied some tow to his tail ; then carrying him to the centre of his own grain-field , set the tow on fire and let the animal go . \" Alas ! \" said the Farmer , seeing the result ; \" if that grain had not been heavily insured , I might have had to dissemble my hatred of the Fox . \" SOME BOYS , playing near a pond , saw a number of Frogs in the water and began to pelt them with stones . They killed several of them , when one of the Frogs , lifting his head out of the water , cried out : \" Pray stop , my boys : what is sport to you , is death to us . \" - \" One man 's pleasure may be another 's pain . \" - In a speech on Monday , Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said the state should meet its obligations to slum dwellers or else drug traffickers will take over the shantytowns . Softball is better than baseball because the Seventh Inning Stretch means stand up and go home . Math is like love ; a simple idea , but it can get complicated . I 'm not saying that the customer service in my bank is bad , but when I went in the other day and asked the clerk to check my balance ... she leaned over and pushed me . A priest who was walking through a small town saw a blackboard outside the front door of a school . It had been washed and put out to dry in the open air . There was a piece of chalk at the foot of the blackboard . The priest took the chalk and wrote in large letters , \" I 'm a priest and I pray for you all . \" A lawyer happened to pass next and when he saw what the priest had written , he added under it , \" I 'm a lawyer and I defend you all . \" Then , a doctor came by , took the piece of chalk , and wrote on the blackboard , \" I 'm a doctor and I cure you all . \" Finally , an ordinary citizen stopped , looked at what the others had written , thought for a few seconds and then added , \" I am an ordinary citizen and I pay for you all . \" He added that Brazil can defeat organized crime only if the government improves the country 's poorest areas . A strain of the bird flu virus that can spread to humans has been found among poultry in northern Nigeria . The Paris-based World Organization for Animal Health says it found a \" highly pathogenic \" version of the H5N1 strain at a chicken farm in the village of Jaji in Kaduna state . This is the first reported case of H5N1 in Africa . The organization says Nigerian authorities have disinfected the premises , and imposed a quarantine and restrictions on the movement of animals . It says it plans to coordinate a joint response to the situation with the U.N. 's Food and Agriculture Organization . Avian flu has killed or forced the slaughter of millions of birds over the last two years . The H5N1 strain has killed at least 88 people in seven countries , mostly in Asia , since late 2003 . The European Parliament has endorsed next week 's planned start of European Union membership talks with Turkey . However , lawmakers on Wednesday also postponed ratifying Turkey 's customs accord with the European Union because of Turkey 's continued refusal to recognize Cyprus , which gained EU membership last year . Also , the European Parliament passed a non-binding resolution calling on Turkey to recognize the massacre of hundreds of thousands of Armenians under the Ottoman Empire as a genocide . Mr. da Silva spoke a few days after a police raid on drug gangs killed at least 13 people in a slum . Armenia says 1.5 million Armenians were slaughtered by the Turks 90 years ago during the final years of the Ottoman Empire . Turkey says 3,00,000 Armenians and thousands of Turks were killed during an Armenian uprising . Police in Afghanistan say suspected Taleban militants have kidnapped four Afghan aid workers in the eastern part of the country . A provincial police chief General Abdul Hanan Raufi said Monday the four aid workers , employed by the International Organization for Migration , were abducted Sunday in eastern Paktia province . He said elders in the area are involved in negotiating for their release . Farther east , the U.-S.-led coalition force says troops captured a known al-Qaida terrorist and five other extremists Monday during an operation near the city of Khost . A military statement did not identify the captured men , but said the troops found grenades , military equipment , armor-piercing rounds and assault rifles during a search of the compound where the men were caught . Russia 's foreign minister says Moscow will let NATO take armored vehicles through its territory to Afghanistan under an expanded transit deal . Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told a news conference in Moscow Thursday that the opening of the Russian route applies to vehicles with anti-mine protection . NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen announced last week at a NATO-Russia Council meeting that Russia had agreed to increase its cooperation on the war in Afghanistan , allowing more equipment to be moved through the country to support NATO troops . The announced investment will provide basic services such as water and sewage systems , as well as basic facilities such as schools and hospitals . Russian President Dmitry Medvedev led the NATO-Russia Council talks in Lisbon . It was the first gathering of the 29-member group since April 2008 , just before Moscow 's brief war with Georgia , a Western ally . Tropical Storm Ophelia has headed northward , as residents of coastal North and South Carolina assess damage from the slow-moving storm . Thousands of homes and businesses remained without power Friday , despite the fact that the nation 's first hurricane since Katrina never officially made landfall . Experts say the Category 1 hurricane caused power outages , flooded streets , and significant damage to buildings because it moved slowly , battering the same area for two days and dumping dozens of centimeters of rain . As Ophelia continues to weaken and move northward , tropical storm watches are in effect for parts of the northeastern U.S. state of Massachusetts and the Canadian province of Nova Scotia . A remote-controlled bomb ripped through the vehicle of an influential pro-government figure in southern Afghanistan Friday , wounding several people and killing at least two others . Tribal elder Mullah Naqib , as well as some of his family members and guards , were wounded in the blast as their vehicle crossed a bridge in Kandahar province . Naqib also was a commander during the resistance to the Soviet occupation in the 1980s . Witnesses say two bystanders also were killed . The money is expected to benefit two million families in the state and city of Rio de Janeiro . In separate news , authorities in northern Afghanistan say police Friday detained eight suspects in connection with Thursday 's killing of a German aid worker . It is not clear if the suspects were militants or bandits . The foreign aid worker was killed when gunmen attacked his vehicle in Sari Pul province . The assailants robbed three Afghan nationals traveling with him . A study indicates that the average level of nicotine in cigarettes has risen 10 percent in the past six years , making it harder for smokers to quit . The health department for the state of Massachusetts released a study this week . It shows how much nicotine content has changed and how much nicotine smokers inhale when they smoke . The study said cigarettes in 2004 yielded the smoker nearly 10 percent more nicotine per cigarette than in 1998 . The increase in nicotine levels varied by brand , with some increasing as much as 30 percent . Fifty two out of 116 brands studied had nicotine increases of more than 10 percent . Brazil 's federal , state , and municipal governments will all contribute to the fund . Health experts say higher nicotine content makes cigarettes more addictive and smoking harder to quit . U.S. tobacco companies have not commented on the study . Turkey has sent more troops and tanks to the Iraqi border , as speculation grows about a possible Turkish incursion against Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq . Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan says his patience has run out for the United States and Iraq to take action against the Kurdish rebels . But U.S. officials have expressed concerns that a cross-border operation could destabilize northern Iraq . Meanwhile , Turkish security forces continue large-scale operations against the Kurdistan Worker 's Party , or PKK , rebels in southeast Turkey . A Turkish soldier in the region was killed Wednesday by a landmine blast . Pressure for action against the PKK is mounting as Turkey prepares for national elections on July 22 , and after two bombings last week . The PKK has been fighting for autonomy in Turkey 's mainly Kurdish southeast since 1984 . The United States , the European Union and Turkey classify the PKK as a terrorist group . The Institute for Science and International Security reports that satellite photos show a possible construction site for a larger nuclear reactor near the small one in the Khushab district of Punjab province .

A South Korean official who visited Washington last week says talks to discuss North Korea 's nuclear program could resume as early as this month . In a radio interview Monday , Kim Sook , director-general for North American affairs at the South Korean Foreign Ministry , said he is cautiously optimistic about the resumption of six-party talks in July . He added that North Korea has not set a firm date for their return to the negotiating table . Mr. Kim joined South Korea 's Unification Minister , Chung Dong-young , in Washington last week for talks with U.S. officials concerning Pyongyang . Reuters quotes Japan 's foreign minister today saying Tokyo 's patience on North Korea 's decision is running out . Nobutaka Machimura told the news agency that Japan is neither optimistic nor pessimistic about the talks resuming anytime soon . Former Sudanese President Jaafar Nimeiri - who imposed strict lslamic law on Sudan - has died . A statement from Sudan 's presidential office says the 79-year-old former leader died from an unspecified illness . It says he will be buried on Sunday in Omdurman near the capital , Khartoum . Mr. Nimeiri came to power in a coup in 1969 and served for 16 years until he too was ousted by a coup in 1985 while visiting the United States . Now , hundreds of Red Cross chapters nationwide are getting ready for the next group of storms . President Nimeiri imposed Islamic Sharia on Sudan in 1983 , a move that alienated the largely non-Muslim south , and is widely viewed as the catalyst for the nation 's 22-year civil war . Following his ouster , Mr. Nimeiri lived in exile in Egypt . He returned to Sudan in 1999 . The Nigerian military has fired on several barges it says were being used by oil smugglers in the Niger Delta region . A helicopter gunship carried out the attack Wednesday in Delta state , near the city of Warri . It was the first known assault by Nigeria 's military in the Delta since local militants carried out a series of attacks against the oil industry , including the kidnapping of four foreign oil workers last month . A local group known as the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta condemned the helicopter strike , saying it targeted ethnic Ijaw communities . The group alleges the helicopter took off from an civilian airstrip operated by Royal Dutch Shell . It threatened to shoot down aircraft using the strip if Nigeria 's military uses it again . The militants want greater local control over southern Nigeria 's oil wealth . VOA 's Carolyn Presutti shows how that is accomplished . The United States says it has temporarily suspended the resettlement of at least 6,000 Hmong refugees from Thailand , after at least a score of refugees already in the U.S. were diagnosed with tuberculosis . At least 20 refugees infected with the disease are in the western U.S. state of California . Health officials say 11 of the patients are children . A handful of other cases were located in the midwestern states of Minnesota and Wisconsin . The U.S. has resettled at least 9,000 Hmong refugees living in the Wat Tham Krabok camp since June of last year . Officials say they will begin enhanced medical treatment and screenings at the camp . The suspension is expected to last for up to six months . Zimbabwe 's ruling party has elected its first woman vice president . At the conclusion of the ZANU-PF party congress Saturday , delegates approved the nomination 49-year old Joyce Mujuru , Zimbabwe 's minister of water and infrastructure . She will share the post with Joseph Msika - filling a vacancy left by Simon Muzenda , who died last year . The United Nations Security Council is expected to discuss a build-up of peacekeeping troops in Ivory Coast later Monday . Ms. Mujuru was President Robert Mugabe 's hand-chosen candidate . Earlier this week , Mr. Mugabe suspended seven top party officials and reprimanded another for allegedly plotting against Ms. Mujuru 's election , in favor of another candidate , parliamentary speaker Emmerson Mnangawa . Analysts said whoever won the vice presidency would be in a good position to possibly succeed Mr. Mugabe , now 80 years old , when he steps down . The United Nations has condemned the killing of an Afghan election worker by suspected Taleban rebels , the first killing linked to parliamentary polls scheduled for September .

Experts with a local seismological bureau told Xinhua that houses in Yanjin were built mostly near hillsides , making them vulnerable to earthquakes . Yanjin is a county on the Yunnan-Guizhou plateau with a population of 3,50,000 people . The head of South Korea 's ruling Uri Party has resigned after parliament failed to pass several pieces of reform legislation by the end of 2004 . Uri Party Chairman Lee Bu-young and members of the party 's standing central committee stepped down Monday citing the failure of his attempts to scrap the National Security Law . The Uri Party vowed to push through a bill repealing the law last year , but the opposition Grand National Party blocked the legislation , saying North Korea still poses a threat to national security .

Those convicted of possessing or distributing illegal drugs face sentences ranging from several years in prison to the death penalty . German officials say that Russia is to remove large quantities of enriched uranium from the Soviet-era atomic reactor in former East Germany . Police said Sunday that more than 300 kilograms of nuclear waste , produced in the Rossendorf reactor near the city of Dresden , was to be flown out of Germany overnight . Germans shut down the Soviet-built research reactor soon after reunification in 1990 . The waste is to be treated in Russia under an international agreement aimed at preventing proliferation of nuclear material . Representatives of U.N. Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency were to observe loading of the nuclear waste into aircraft at the Dresden airport . Iran continues to downplay the threat of U.S. military strikes , and says any U.S. attack on the Islamic republic would be a strategic mistake . Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi told a news conference Sunday the chance of a U.S. strike is very low , echoing recent comments from President Mohammad Khatami . Washington and Tehran have been locked in a three-year stand-off over U.S. allegations that Iran is using its nuclear program to develop banned weapons . Lawyers in the case have said Mr. Fitzgerald may ask the jury to issue charges against President Bush 's chief advisor , Karl Rove , and Vice President Dick Cheney 's chief of staff , Lewis Libby . Iran has repeatedly denied the charges . Last week , a published report said U.S. commandos have carried out clandestine missions in Iran to identify targets for possible military strikes . The White House rejected The New Yorker magazine report , but President Bush later said military action to deal with Iran 's nuclear threat had not been ruled out . Sunday , Mr. Asefi characterized the president 's comments as psychological warfare . Security forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina have detained a former Bosnian Serb paramilitary leader suspected of crimes against humanity during the Balkan conflict of the 1990s . Authorities say they picked up Momir Savic in the southeastern town of Visegrad . Prosecutors issued a warrant for Savic 's arrest on suspicion of war crimes against Muslim civilians in the Visegrad area in 1992 , as ethnic Serb forces killed or expelled most of the Muslims and Croats from eastern Bosnia . Authorities gave no further details . The Bosnian conflict formally ended with the 1995 Dayton Accord , which divided the country into two entities , the Bosnian Serb Republic and the Muslim-Croat Federation . Brazil 's president declared the country independent of the need for foreign oil as he opened a huge new offshore oilrig in the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday . Mr. Fitzgerald has been conducting a nearly two-year investigation into whether someone in the Bush administration blew the cover of a CIA operative ( Valerie Plame ) in 2003 . President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva flipped a switch and drenched his hands in the flowing oil . His gesture recreated one made by President Getulio Vargas when he created the government-run Petrobras oil company in 1953 . Ironically , the new rig came online in the same week that oil prices set record highs . Roughly 30 years ago , Brazil imported about 80 percent of its oil . Petrobras says that when the huge new P-50 oil rig is producing at full capacity six months from now , Brazil 's oil production will average 1.9 million barrels a day , slightly more than the nation 's average daily consumption of 1.85 barrels a day . A cease-fire due to be signed Friday by the Ugandan government and rebels to end an 18-year war in the north of the country has been postponed .

The Russian officials say both sides expressed readiness to cooperate in efforts to deal with tensions in the Middle East , Central Asia and Afghanistan . The White House has generally refused to comment on the probe , although media reports indicate Bush administration officials are bracing for at least one indictment . They said Mr. Blair stressed the importance of tightening British anti-terrorist legislation . The meeting came ahead of ceremonies in which Mr. Putin honored the British team that helped rescue seven Russian sailors trapped in a submarine off the coast of Russia 's Kamchatka Peninsula last August . Tuesday , Mr. Putin and European Union leaders held a summit in London . President Bush has condemned the terrorist attacks at three hotels in Jordan , and expressed his condolences to King Abdullah and the country 's people .

United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan condemned the attacks and renewed a call for U.N. members to advance a comprehensive plan to combat terrorism . U.N. officials said Mr. Annan , who is currently on a Middle East trip , has canceled plans to visit Jordan this week . A Vietnamese man has died from bird flu , raising the country 's death toll from the deadly virus to 39 . Health officials say the Hanoi resident died Tuesday after being hospitalized six days earlier . United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan will formally present Monday a report that calls for major reforms of the world body . It was unclear how the man contracted bird flu . The Vietnamese government says it will begin nationwide vaccinations of poultry in August in an effort to contain the spread of the virus , which has also killed 12 people in Thailand and four others from Cambodia . Medical experts say the H5N1 virus that causes bird flu appears to be spread only by close contact between humans and infected poultry . However , they warn that bird flu could change into a form that can easily pass between people , triggering a global pandemic . Members of the Philippine Senate have urged President Gloria Arroyo to pressure Burma 's military government to free pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi . All 23 members of the Senate signed a resolution urging the action Wednesday . It is nonbinding , meaning it only serves to express the lawmakers ' opinions .

An Iranian news agency says authorities have reinstated 300 more candidates ahead of next month 's parliamentary elections , bringing the total reinstated in the past week to almost 600 . Iran 's official news agency , IRNA , quotes an official as saying the candidates ' names will be released later Saturday . Iran 's Interior Ministry banned more than 2,200 candidates , mostly reformists , from competing in the March 14 vote . Several days ago , Iran 's highest oversight body , the Guardian Council , said that it had reinstated 280 of those candidates . Iranian authorities can disqualify candidates who are not deemed as showing sufficient loyalty to Iran 's Islamic system . The accuser , who testified in a California court Thursday , was a 13-year old cancer patient at the time of the alleged incidents . Reformists and conservatives have strongly criticized the mass disqualifications , warning that they undermine the election process . British Prime Minister Tony Blair has again defended plans to toughen anti-terrorism laws and detain suspects for three months without charge . Mr. Blair told his monthly news conference in London that police have made compelling arguments to extend the length of detention from its current two weeks . He says authorities are fighting a new kind of terrorism , which requires more time to investigate and often the cooperation of foreign agencies . But civil rights activists and opposition politicians say the changes are counterproductive and will undermine efforts by authorities to get more cooperation from Britain 's Muslim community . Mr. Blair proposed the new laws , which would also allow authorities to deport extremists , after the July 7 suicide bombings in London that killed 52 people . Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez warns that he will not renew the license of a television station he accuses of backing a failed coup against him in 2002 . Mr. Chavez said in a speech Thursday to the military that the concession for Radio Caracas Television will end in March . Earlier , the information minister , William Lara , said the broadcaster 's license would expire next May . Mr. Chavez also said he will not tolerate any media outlets that support efforts to remove him from power . Mr. Jackson had invited him and his family for a visit in 2003 . There was no immediate response from the Caracas-based station . President Chavez has repeatedly denounced RCTV and other pro-opposition broadcasters for what he says is overly critical coverage of his government . The press rights group Reporters Without Borders has urged Venezuela to end its efforts to shut down RCTV . The death toll from Saturday 's collapse of a metal exposition hall roof in the southern Polish city of Katowice continues to climb . Officials now say they have pulled at least 26 bodies from the rubble . A spokesman for the government of the Silesia region , where Katowice is located , said another 130 were injured . Police say about 500 people from Poland and other countries across Europe were inside the facility attending a homing pigeon exhibition . Officials say several foreigners were believed to be among the casualties , but there are conflicting reports about their nationalities and condition . Officials say the collapse was likely the result of the weight of snow on the roof after heavy snows and an arctic freeze that swept through Poland and neighboring countries this week . Temperatures plunged to minus 15 degrees Celsius as rescue efforts continued . The teen also testified that the entertainer urged him to drink wine aboard his private jet and hard liquor at the singer 's ranch . Israeli troops and tanks entered the northern Gaza Strip Sunday , hours after Israel ended an operation against Palestinian militants in southern Gaza . The Beit Hanoun operation began soon after Israeli forces withdrew from Khan Younis after a three-day assault . Israel says both raids were aimed at stopping militants from firing rockets and mortar shells at Israeli settlements and towns . The Israeli military actions come one week before Palestinian elections to replace the late Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat . A new opinion survey by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research shows Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Mahmoud Abbas with a 65-to-22 percent lead over his nearest rival , Mustafa Barghouti . Mr. Abbas has vowed to protect Palestinian militants from Israeli raids . He also has criticized attacks on Israelis , saying they are not productive . An auction house in Hong Kong has broken the price-per-carat record for a gemstone auctioned off , with the sale of a six-carat blue diamond at nearly $ 8 million . Sotheby 's of Hong Kong announced the sale Monday , noting that the price comes out to $ 1.32 million a carat . The sale bested a 20-year record held by a diamond known as the \" Hancock Red \" that fetched just over $ 9,00,000 per carat in 1987 . Mr. Jackson has denied all the charges against him . The buyer for the diamond is Moussaieff Jewelers , a London-based jeweler that collects rare gemstones . The diamond is said to be in perfect condition with a rare , vivid blue color - the result of the element boron in the stone 's crystal structure . The Iraqi government 's top executive body , called the president 's council , has issued a controversial law that allows some former members of Saddam Hussein 's Baath Party to return to government service . The Kurdish , Jalal Talabani , and Shi'ite , Adel Abdul-Mahdi , representatives of the three-member presidency council issued the law Sunday despite the objection of the Sunni representative , Tareq al-Hashemi . Sunni politicians say the law contains provisions that will force out many current government workers . The law is one of 18 pieces of so-called benchmark legislation aimed at achieving reconciliation among Iraq 's Kurdish , Sunni Arab and Shi'ite communities . Meanwhile , the U.S. military says the bodies of four Iraqi militia members working with U.S. forces were recovered in Baquba Sunday . The military also said coalition forces killed three suspected terrorists and captured 36 others in the last two days in operations in central and northern Iraq . Bosnian officials say DNA tests on human remains taken from mass graves have identified 50 victims of the war in Croatia in the early 1990s . Experts in Bosnian and Croatian laboratories compared the DNA with blood samples taken from more than 750 families who have reported missing relatives . Thursday 's testimony came after the judge threatened to jail Mr. Jackson and revoke his bail when he arrived more than one hour late for court . Fifty of the samples led to positive identifications . A Bosnian official calls the results extraordinary . The Sarajevo-based International Commission for Missing Persons runs one of the world 's most sophisticated DNA laboratories The lab helped identify victims of the September 11 , 2001 terror attacks on the United States and last year 's Asian tsunami . The United States has announced it is giving $ 40 million worth of food aid to Bangladesh , which is facing shortages after flooding and a devastating cyclone last year . U.S. Ambassador to Bangladesh James Moriarty said Sunday in Dhaka the aid will go to school children , along with cyclone and flood victims . Last year 's Cyclone Sidr killed an estimated 3,500 people and left another two million homeless . The cyclone also destroyed roughly two million tons of rice . The Bangladeshi government has said this year 's rice crop looks like it will be plentiful , but it is still anticipating possible rice shortages . Bermuda enjoys the third highest per capita income in the world , more than 50 % higher than that of the US ; the average cost of a house by the mid-2000s exceeded $ 10,00,000 . An official with the German firm Bilfinger Berger , Thomas Horbach , said the gunmen stopped the supply boat Wednesday as it sailed from Delta State to Bayelsa State to inspect an offshore oil field owned by Royal-Dutch Shell . It is the leading cause of kidney failure . A Jackson spokesman said the star had been hospitalized for a serious back injury . Its economy is primarily based on providing financial services for international business and luxury facilities for tourists . A number of reinsurance companies relocated to the island following the 11 September 2001 attacks and again after Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 contributing to the expansion of an already robust international business sector . Bermuda 's tourism industry - which derives over 80 % of its visitors from the US - continues to struggle but remains the island 's number two industry . Most capital equipment and food must be imported . Bermuda 's industrial sector is largely focused on construction and agriculture is limited , with only 20 % of the land being arable . The former French colony of Ubangi-Shari became the Central African Republic upon independence in 1960 . After three tumultuous decades of misrule - mostly by military governments - civilian rule was established in 1993 and lasted for one decade . President Ange-Felix PATASSE 's civilian government was plagued by unrest , and in March 2003 he was deposed in a military coup led by General Francois BOZIZE , who established a transitional government . Though the government has the tacit support of civil society groups and the main parties , a wide field of candidates contested the municipal , legislative , and presidential elections held in March and May of 2005 in which General BOZIZE was affirmed as president . The government still does not fully control the countryside , where pockets of lawlessness persist . Pakistan has denied allegations by Moscow that militants have been training on Pakistani territory to carry out terrorist attacks in Russia and the former Soviet central Asian nations . Unrest in the neighboring nations of Chad , Sudan , and the DRC continues to affect stability in the Central African Republic as well . The Gilbert Islands became a British protectorate in 1892 and a colony in 1915 ; they were captured by the Japanese in the Pacific War in 1941 . The islands of Makin and Tarawa were the sites of major US amphibious victories over entrenched Japanese garrisons in 1943 . The Gilbert Islands were granted self-rule by the UK in 1971 and complete independence in 1979 under the new name of Kiribati . The US relinquished all claims to the sparsely inhabited Phoenix and Line Island groups in a 1979 treaty of friendship with Kiribati . Spain 's mixed capitalist economy is the 12th largest in the world , and its per capita income roughly matches that of Germany and France . However , after almost 15 years of above average GDP growth , the Spanish economy began to slow in late 2007 and entered into a recession in the second quarter of 2008 . GDP contracted by 3.7 % in 2009 , ending a 16-year growth trend , and by another 0.2 % in 2010 , making Spain the last major economy to emerge from the global recession . The reversal in Spain 's economic growth reflected a significant decline in construction amid an oversupply of housing and falling consumer spending , while exports actually have begun to grow . Government efforts to boost the economy through stimulus spending , extended unemployment benefits , and loan guarantees did not prevent a sharp rise in the unemployment rate , which rose from a low of about 8 % in 2007 to 20 % in 2010 . Foreign ministry spokesman Jalil Abbas Jilani in Islamabad Saturday said there are no militant training facilities in Pakistan . The government budget deficit worsened from 3.8 % of GDP in 2008 to 9.2 % of GDP in 2010 , more than three times the euro-zone limit . Spain 's large budget deficit and poor economic growth prospects have made it vulnerable to financial contagion from other highly-indebted euro zone members despite the government 's efforts to cut spending , privatize industries , and boost competitiveness through labor market reforms . Spanish banks ' high exposure to the collapsed domestic construction and real estate market also poses a continued risk for the sector . The government oversaw a restructuring of the savings bank sector in 2010 , and provided some $ 15 billion in capital to various institutions . Investors remain concerned that Madrid may need to bail out more troubled banks . The Bank of Spain , however , is seeking to boost confidence in the financial sector by pressuring banks to come clean about their losses and consolidate into stronger groups . A CROW in great want of food saw a Serpent asleep in a sunny nook , and flying down , greedily seized him . The Serpent , turning about , bit the Crow with a mortal wound . In the agony of death , the bird exclaimed : \" O unhappy me ! who have found in that which I deemed a happy windfall the source of my destruction . \" He said the role and sacrifices made by Islamabad , a key U.S. ally in the war on terror , have been acknowledged by the international community . AT ONE TIME the Horse had the plain entirely to himself . Then a Stag intruded into his domain and shared his pasture . The Horse , desiring to revenge himself on the stranger , asked a man if he were willing to help him in punishing the Stag . The man replied that if the Horse would receive a bit in his mouth and agree to carry him , he would contrive effective weapons against the Stag . The Horse consented and allowed the man to mount him . From that hour he found that instead of obtaining revenge on the Stag , he had enslaved himself to the service of man . THE people of Madagonia had an antipathy to the people of Novakatka and set upon some sailors of a Novakatkan vessel , killing two and wounding twelve . The King of Madagonia having refused either to apologise or pay , the King of Novakatka made war upon him , saying that it was necessary to show that Novakatkans must not be slaughtered . In the battles which ensued the people of Madagonia slaughtered two thousand Novakatkans and wounded twelve thousand . But the Madagonians were unsuccessful , which so chagrined them that never thereafter in all their land was a Novakatkan secure in property or life . His comments come one day after Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow had information that people are being trained in Afghanistan and Pakistan with the help of Taleban insurgents to carry out attacks inside Russia . Softball is better than baseball because you do n't have to watch your team lose for NINE innings . Ukraine 's Supreme Court has halted official publication of the results of the December 26 presidential election . The high court announced Tuesday it must first review an appeal from former Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych , who officials say lost the race to opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko . The results must be printed in two government newspapers before the winner can be inaugurated . Election officials say Mr. Yushchenko garnered 52 percent support in the court-ordered repeat election , over Mr. Yanukovych 's 44 percent . The former prime minister is alleging widespread fraud in the hotly contested race , and has filed a number of complaints with the Supreme Court and electoral officials . The December election replaced a November run-off that the high court said was rigged in favor of Mr. Yanukovych . Top officials with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe have congratulated Mr. Yushchenko on the election .

Russia 's President Vladimir Putin has made more harsh comments about the Bush administration , accusing it of using what he calls a \" nonexistent Russian threat \" to get more defense spending from Congress . Mr. Putin said during a visit to Jordan Tuesday that the administration has used the \" Russian card \" to address its political problems , including the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and for the deployment of a missile defense system . He said he only expressed what many other countries also believe , when he complained last week about what he described as the almost uncontained use of U.S. military force . The White House called his remarks disappointing . Last week , U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates spoke to a congressional committee and identified Russia as a potential threat . Two armed Pakistani inmates were holed up in Afghanistan 's main prison Friday , after an escape attempt that left at least five people dead .

India and Sri Lanka say peace talks with Tamil rebels should resume early in order to prevent the island nation from plunging back into civil war . The call was made after visiting Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse met with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and briefed him about his government 's efforts to restart peace talks with Tamil Tiger rebels . An Indian spokesman said both countries agreed about the need to strengthen the almost three-year-old ceasefire , which is becoming fragile . Both the Tigers and the Sri Lankan government have agreed to hold talks , but the government insists they must take place in an Asian country , while the rebels want to hold them in Norway , which brokered a 2002 truce . In New Delhi , Mr. Rajapakse is also holding talks on enhancing economic cooperation and trade relations with India .

More than one million people died at the Auschwitz camp in southern Poland - most of them Jews - before it was liberated by Soviet troops on January 27 , 1945 . The camp was part of a network set up by Nazi Germany during World War II to exterminate Jews and anyone else it considered undesirable . The anniversary commemoration at the camp site , which is now a museum , is expected to draw a range of foreign officials . Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian briefly joined a massive rally Saturday in Taipei to protest China 's threat to use force against the island if it formally declares independence . Speaking to more than 1,00,000 protesters , Mr. Chen told the crowd that Taiwan is an independent , sovereign state . He said the island 's future should not be decided by China . Most of the victims came in contact with infected poultry . Demonstrators chanted slogans such as \" Loving Peace , Opposing Missiles , \" and \" Oppose Annexation . \" The rally comes amid this week 's one-year anniversary of China 's approval of an anti-secession law . The law says China will employ \" non-peaceful means \" to prevent Taiwan 's independence if efforts at peaceful reunification fail . Mr. Chen angered Beijing last month when he decided to stop funding a unification council and scrap guidelines for reunification with China . China and Taiwan split in 1949 after a civil war , but Beijing considers Taiwan a renegade province . Israel forces say they killed a Palestinian militant in the Gaza Strip during a gunbattle early Friday . The army says three Palestinians began firing missiles and small arms at Israeli soldiers from an abandoned building near the Gaza settlement of Kfar Darom . As Israeli forces returned fire , two of the militants escaped , but an army spokesman says the third man was killed . Three militant groups , Hamas , the Popular Resistance Committees and the Al-Aqsa Martyrs ' Brigade , say they were involved in the attempt to infiltrate the Jewish settlement . Today 's clash further strained a shaky three-month cease-fire . Cuba and Panama have said they will restore consular relations , months after Havana broke ties with Panama City for pardoning four men convicted in connection with an assassination attempt against Cuban President Fidel Castro . Experts fear the virus could mutate into a form that is easily transmissible by human-to-human contact . Hamas and the Al-Aqsa Martyrs ' Brigade have pledged to respect the truce , but both groups say they are determined to avenge Israel 's recent military actions in Gaza . The Israeli military has been ordered Thursday to use all means necessary to suppress Gaza militants ' attacks on Jewish targets . U.S. officials in Afghanistan say a member of a Special Operations team missing since Tuesday has been rescued in the eastern part of the country . Defense Department officials say he is a member of the elite Navy Seals . The sailor was wounded , but evaded the enemy until his rescue on Sunday . He has been flown to a U.S. military hospital in Germany . Three other members of his Navy Seals team are still missing . U.S. and Afghan troops are scouring the mountainous region in Kunar province looking for them . The Navy commandos went missing Tuesday after calling for help during a battle with insurgents while on a reconnaissance mission . The U.S. military helicopter sent to rescue them was shot down by suspected Taleban militants , killing all 16 U.S. service members aboard . The mayor of Los Angeles , Antonio Villaraigosa , says authorities know of no credible threats to the western U.S. city , following a warning from a suspected al-Qaida member . Pope Benedict XVI waves from his studio 's window overlooking St. Peter 's Square during the Angelus prayer Pope Benedict has called on the terrorists responsible for last week 's London bombings to , in his words , \" stop in the name of God . \" Speaking at the Vatican Sunday , the pontiff urged the faithful to pray not only for the London victims and their families , but also for the attackers . The pope said he hopes God will touch their hearts . In comments directed at the terrorists , Benedict said , \" God loves life , which he created , not death . \" Benedict made his plea following his weekly blessing in St. Peter 's Square . On the day of the London transport system bombings , the German-born pope condemned the attacks as \" barbaric acts against humanity . \" Iran 's president says Tehran will never abandon its nuclear activities , but will continue talks , for now , on its nuclear program with the European Union and the International Atomic Energy Agency . In an interview with a French newspaper , Le Figaro , President Mohammed Khatami said Iran is ready to consider any reasonable solution , but will not suspend its nuclear activities permanently . He said the Europeans must understand that the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and other international agreements allow Iran to develop nuclear technology for peaceful purposes . The warning came in a videotaped statement aired by the U.S. television network ABC on Sunday . France , Germany and Britain , with U.S. support , are offering Iran economic incentives in exchange for its suspension of uranium enrichment activity . The enrichment process , which makes fuel for civilian reactors , can also be used to make weapons grade material . The United States accuses Iran of secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons . Iran denies the charge . Kevin Costner is suing a music promoter , alleging the company breached a contract to back his fledgling music career . The 52-year-old movie actor-turned-musician filed an April 3 lawsuit against Mahee Worldwide Ventures Inc. , accusing it of fraud and breach of contract . Costner is seeking damages in excess of $ 8.5 million . Kevin Costner is the lead singer and songwriter for the Kevin Costner Band . The lawsuit claims Costner 's music company , Kevin 's Music LLC , entered into a two-year agreement with Mahee Worldwide Ventures which would allow the band to perform as many as five concerts annually . Mahee would also create and maintain a Web site marketing Costner 's band . A masked man on the tape says \" Allah willing , \" Los Angeles and the Australian city of Melbourne will be attacked . The suit claims Mahee reneged on all its agreements . Mahee Worldwide Ventures has not responded to requests for comment . The International Monetary Fund says Haiti qualifies for partial cancellation of its debt . Takatoshi Kato , the IMF 's deputy managing director , said Tuesday that Haiti has an unsustainable amount of debt and therefore is eligible for assistance under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative . The impoverished country is struggling to manage roughly $ 1 billion in debt . The Fund said in July that under the IMF-World Bank initiative , Haiti could receive up to $ 14 million in credit in the first year and possibly additional contributions of $ 22 million . Kato said the IMF welcomes the Haitian government 's commitment to policies aimed at sustaining macroeconomic stability . But , he said Haiti needs continued financial support from the international community as the country faces challenges in the areas of security , social conditions and sustained income growth . A Moroccan court has sentenced to death two radical Islamists convicted of leading a terror cell . Prosecutors say the two , Toufik Hanouichi and Mohcine Bouarfa , led a group that killed several Moroccans , including a Moroccan Jew . ABC says the tape was delivered to its office in Pakistan on Saturday . Four people arrested with them were given life sentences . Another 31 cell members were given prison terms of one to 20 years , and nine were acquitted . Most of the terror cell members were arrested in January , 2004 , during a massive police operation in the towns of Meknes and Fez . Morocco has not carried out a death sentence in more than a decade . Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf says India will allow leaders of Kashmir 's main separatist political alliance to visit Pakistan for talks on the disputed region 's future . Pakistan has invited an alliance of about two dozen Kashmiri separatist groups known as the All Parties Hurriyat Conference to visit on June 2 . India has previously denied permission to Hurriyat leaders to visit Pakistan , saying the Kashmir dispute is India 's internal matter . But in an interview with the Daily Times published Tuesday , General Musharraf speaks of a breakthrough , saying this time Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has allowed Hurriyat leaders to travel to Pakistan . He said once they talk to Pakistan and then India , there will be a trilateral arrangement going . There has been no word from New Delhi . It says the speaker is probably Adam Gadahn , a U.S. citizen wanted for questioning by the FBI for possible terrorist activity . General Musharraf met the Kashmiri separatist leaders last month during his visit to New Delhi . The United Nations has launched an urgent appeal for more than $ 20 million to build shelter for people left homeless by a devastating earthquake in Pakistan and a demolition drive in Zimbabwe . The Nairobi-based U.N. Human Settlement Program , popularly known as HABITAT , has asked donors to contribute $ 22 million for the appeal . HABITAT chief Ann Tibaijuka has issued a statement , saying there is an urgent need to stabilize the shelter conditions of poor people evicted in Zimbabwe , and those left out in the open in Pakistan . More than $ 18 million will be spent in Pakistan , where more than three million people were left homeless by the October quake . The remainder is to be used in a U.N.-backed program to build 2,500 semi-permanent housing units for at least 12,500 Zimbabweans . China has criticized Japan 's defense agency for charting out scenarios for a potential Chinese military attack against Japan . A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue accused Japan of having , in her words , a \" Cold War mentality , \" adding that the scenarios were without merit . Japanese media reported Monday that a Japanese defense agency review presented three possibilities for Chinese action against Japan . It says China might take action to secure Chinese interests in a gas field in the East China Sea , to seize a disputed set of islands known as Daioyu in China and Senkaku in Japanto or to keep U.S. forces based in Japan from protecting Taiwan . Officials in both Los Angeles and Melbourne say the tape was meant to instill fear , and have advised residents to go about their normal lives . The Japanese report advises using diplomatic means to keep the situation stable . Some of this information provided by Reuters and AP . Defending World Cup football champion Brazil has defeated Croatia , 1-0 , in the opening match for both teams in Germany .

The Swiss and French teams sputtered to their third draw in as many encounters . Britain says a raid by multinational forces in Iraq has freed three Western Christian aid workers who had been held hostage by Muslim militants since November . U.S. intelligence officials have refused to comment on whether the taped warning is authentic . The announcement of the release of the two Canadians and one Briton has been made in London by British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw . \" This is wonderful news for the family and it 's a huge tribute to the professionalism of the multinational forces and the Iraqi forces that they 've been able to achieve this result , \" he said . Straw says 74-year-old Norman Kember of Britain is in reasonable condition after the raid . However , he says , Canadian citizens James Loney and Harmeet Singh Sooden have required hospital treatment . A fourth hostage , American Tom Fox , was found shot to death on March 10 . All four men had been kidnapped in November by a Muslim militant group called the Swords of Righteousness Brigade . Sao Tome 's prime minister , Damiao Vaz de Almeida , has resigned following contentious oil deals negotiated by the president . The Associated Press quotes Mr. Vaz de Almeida as saying he objected to President Fradique de Menezes awarding oil exploration deals to Nigerian companies , which he said were \" of doubtful credibility and inadequate technical ability . \" According to the report , Mr. Vaz de Almeida was angered by the president 's refusal to back the government this week during a major civil servants ' strike over pay . Mr. Vaz de Almeida had been in office for about eight months . The U.S. military says it has uncovered a large stockpile of weapons inside a Fallujah mosque led by a key insurgent leader . Two years ago , President Menezes was briefly removed from power in a bloodless coup by rebellious soldiers . They demanded more transparency in oil contracts , following the discovery of large oil reserves . A senior Iranian official has warned countries opposed to Tehran 's nuclear program that they will face retaliation if sanctions are imposed on Iran . Iran 's top nuclear negotiator , Ali Larijani , issued the warning in comments to reporters in Tehran Friday . Larijani said Western nations will face \" painful \" measures if the United Nations Security Council imposes sanctions on Iran for its nuclear program . The permanent U.N. Security Council members plus Germany are trying to reach agreement on a sanctions resolution . Iran ignored an August 31st UN deadline to suspend uranium enrichment . The U.S. and its western allies believe Iran 's enrichment activities are part of a program to develop nuclear weapons . Iran says its nuclear program is to produce energy , not weapons . A United Nations war crimes court has sentenced a former Rwandan administrator to 25 years in prison for his role in the country 's 1994 genocide . The military did not specify the number of weapons found , but called it the \" largest weapons cache to date in the city \" - a one-time rebel bastion . The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda , based in Tanzania , found Dominique Ntawukulilyayo guilty of genocide . Court prosecutors say Ntawukulilyayo , who was deputy administrator of Rwanda 's southern Gisagara district , transported soldiers to an area where thousands of Tutsis had taken refuge , leaving the soldiers to carry out a mass slaughter . Ntawukulilyayo was arrested in France in 2007 and later transferred to the U.N. detention facility in Arusha to face charges . Hutu extremists killed an estimated 8,00,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus during the 1994 Rwandan genocide . The U.N. tribunal was set up to prosecute those who organized the killings . The court has convicted about 40 people so far , while about 30 suspects are either being tried or awaiting trial . World leaders are hailing key general elections in Afghanistan , saying Afghans have braved Taleban violence in a show of determination to build a peaceful future . President Bush congratulated the Afghan people and the government for a successful vote . He said it was a major step forward in Afghanistan 's development as a democratic state governed by the rule of law . U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the extremist elements that once again attempted to disrupt the electoral process have failed . The countries agreed to reopen their consulates , following a meeting Friday between Panamanian President Martin Torrijos and Cuban Vice President Carlos Lage . U.S. and Iraqi government forces are continuing to sweep Fallujah after an assault on the city earlier this month . Pakistan 's Foreign Ministry said the completion of the electoral process in Afghanistan was a big step forward on the road to peace and stability , national reconstruction and development . The European Union , the United Nations and NATO hailed the election and praised those who voted . Afghan President Hamid Karzai called the election a defeat for terrorism . NATO 's secretary general says a proposed U.S. missile defense system in Europe risks splitting the alliance between those countries it would fully protect and those left vulnerable to threats . Jaap de Hoop Scheffer 's warning appeared Monday in an interview with the British newspaper , The Financial Times . Experts say the proposed missile system in Poland and the Czech Republic would shield most of Europe from any attacks from what Washington calls rogue states such as Iran or North Korea . But NATO officials told the newspaper that countries in southeastern Europe such as Turkey , Greece and Italy would need extra short-range missile protection because of their proximity to Iran . De Hoop Scheffer suggests that the proposed U.S. system could be complemented by NATO plans for a smaller , mobile system scheduled to become operational in 2010 . Venezuela 's ambassador to Washington is calling on the U.S. to extradite a Cuban militant accused of planning a deadly airplane bombing in 1976 . Ambassador Bernardo Alvarez told Venezuelan state television Monday the extradition of Luis Posada Carriles should not be considered an immigration issue . In southern Iraqi city of Basra , police said they arrested five Arab foreigners suspected of planning attacks . Carriles is a former CIA operative who is considered to be the mastermind behind the in-flight bombing of a Cubana Airlines plane that killed 73 people . He is being held in a detention center in the U.S. state of Texas for immigration violations . Alvarez called Carriles the \" Osama bin Laden \" of Latin America . He said he discussed the extradition request with U.S. Under Secretary of State Thomas Shannon last month . Venezuela 's government often clashes with Washington . Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez sharply criticized President Bush Sunday , days after a White House report called Mr. Chavez a demagogue . William C. Walbrecher Jr. , an executive at San Francisco-based 1st Nationwide Bank , was named president and chief executive officer of Citadel Holding Corp. and its principal operating unit , Fidelity Federal Bank . The appointment takes effect Nov. 13 . He succeeds James A. Taylor , who stepped down as chairman , president and chief executive in March for health reasons . Edward L. Kane succeeded Mr. Taylor as chairman . A senior police official said the two Saudi nationals , two Tunisians and one Libyan , who were arrested late Wednesday , had escaped from Fallujah four days ago . Separately , Citadel posted a third-quarter net loss of $ 2.3 million , or 68 cents a share , versus net income of $ 5.3 million , or $ 1.61 a share , a year earlier . The latest results include some unusual write-downs , which had an after-tax impact of $ 4.9 million . Those included costs associated with the potential Valley Federal Savings and Loan Association acquisition , which was terminated on Sept. 27 , 1989 . In addition , operating results were hit by an increase in loan and real estate loss reserves . In American Stock Exchange composite trading , Citadel shares closed yesterday at $ 45.75 , down 25 cents . Oil-rich Nigeria has been hobbled by political instability , corruption , inadequate infrastructure , and poor macroeconomic management but in 2008 began pursuing economic reforms . Nigeria 's former military rulers failed to diversify the economy away from its overdependence on the capital-intensive oil sector , which provides 95 % of foreign exchange earnings and about 80 % of budgetary revenues . Following the signing of an IMF stand-by agreement in August 2000 , Nigeria received a debt-restructuring deal from the Paris Club and a $ 1 billion credit from the IMF , both contingent on economic reforms . Nigeria pulled out of its IMF program in April 2002 , after failing to meet spending and exchange rate targets , making it ineligible for additional debt forgiveness from the Paris Club . In November 2005 , Abuja won Paris Club approval for a debt-relief deal that eliminated $ 18 billion of debt in exchange for $ 12 billion in payments - a total package worth $ 30 billion of Nigeria 's total $ 37 billion external debt . European Union officials say transportation and other logistical problems are holding up some of the massive amounts of humanitarian aid European countries have offered to victims of Hurricane Katrina . Since 2008 the government has begun to show the political will to implement the market-oriented reforms urged by the IMF , such as modernizing the banking system , curbing inflation by blocking excessive wage demands , and resolving regional disputes over the distribution of earnings from the oil industry . GDP rose strongly in 2007 - 10 because of increased oil exports and high global crude prices in 2010 . President JONATHAN has pledged to continue the economic reforms of his predecessor with emphasis on infrastructure improvements . Infrastructure is the main impediment to growth and in August 2010 JONATHAN unveiled a power sector blueprint that includes privatization of the state-run electricity generation and distribution facilities . The government also is working toward developing stronger public-private partnerships for roads . Nigeria 's financial sector was hurt by the global financial and economic crises and the Central Bank governor has taken measures to strengthen that sector . Bahrain is one of the most diversified economies in the Persian Gulf . Highly developed communication and transport facilities make Bahrain home to numerous multinational firms with business in the Gulf . As part of its diversification plans , Bahrain implemented a Free Trade Agreement ( FTA ) with the US in August 2006 , the first FTA between the US and a Gulf state . Bahrain 's economy , however , continues to depend heavily on oil . In Brussels Tuesday , a spokeswoman for the European Commission said a Swedish plane loaded with food and water treatment tools was ready to take off , but had not received approval from Washington to enter U.S. airspace . Petroleum production and refining account for more than 60 % of Bahrain 's export receipts , 70 % of government revenues , and 11 % of GDP ( exclusive of allied industries ) . Other major economic activities are production of aluminum - Bahrain 's second biggest export after oil - finance , and construction . Bahrain competes with Malaysia as a worldwide center for Islamic banking and continues to seek new natural gas supplies as feedstock to support its expanding petrochemical and aluminum industries . Unemployment , especially among the young , is a long-term economic problem Bahrain struggles to address . In 2009 , to help lower unemployment among Bahraini nationals , Bahrain reduced sponsorship for expatriate workers , increasing the costs of employing foreign labor . The global financial crisis caused funding for many non-oil projects to dry up and resulted in slower economic growth for Bahrain . Other challenges facing Bahrain include the slow growth of government debt as a result of a large subsidy program , the financing of large government projects , and debt restructuring , such as the bailout of state-owned Gulf Air . San Marino 's economy relies heavily on its tourism and banking industries , as well as on the manufacture and export of ceramics , clothing , fabrics , furniture , paints , spirits , tiles , and wine . The per capita level of output and standard of living are comparable to those of the most prosperous regions of Italy , which supplies much of its food . The economy benefits from foreign investment due to its relatively low corporate taxes and low taxes on interest earnings . She said EU authorities have suggested to the Bush administration that aid could flow more easily if it was placed aboard military planes at U.S. air bases in Europe . San Marino has recently faced increased international pressure to improve cooperation with foreign tax authorities and transparency within its own banking sector , which generates about one-fifth of the country 's tax revenues . Italy 's implementation in October 2009 of a tax amnesty to repatriate untaxed funds held abroad has resulted in financial outflows from San Marino to Italy worth more than $ 4.5 billion . Such outflows , combined with a money-laundering scandal at San Marino 's largest financial institution and the recent global economic downturn , have contributed to a deep recession and growing budget deficit . Industrial production declined sharply in 2010 , especially in the textile sector . However , San Marino has little national debt , and an unemployment rate less than half the size of Italy 's . The San Marino government has adopted measures to counter the downturn , including subsidized credit to businesses . San Marino also continues to work towards harmonizing its fiscal laws with EU members and international standards . In September 2009 , the OECD removed San Marino from its list of tax havens that have yet to fully implement global tax standards , and in 2010 San Marino signed Tax Information Exchange Agreements with most major countries . The future of the country 's economy will be heavily influenced by the signing of a financial information exchange agreement with Italy , which many Italian investors see as fundamental for their business operations with San Marino . Revenues of this tiny island traditionally have come from exports of phosphates . More than 20 countries have offered emergency aid teams , tents , meals , water and aircraft to help in the massive relief effort . Few other resources exist , with most necessities being imported , mainly from Australia , its former occupier and later major source of support . In 2005 an Australian company entered into an agreement to exploit remaining supplies . Primary reserves of phosphates were exhausted and mining ceased in 2006 , but mining of a deeper layer of \" secondary phosphate \" in the interior of the island began the following year . The secondary phosphate deposits may last another 30 years . The rehabilitation of mined land and the replacement of income from phosphates are serious long-term problems . In anticipation of the exhaustion of Nauru 's phosphate deposits , substantial amounts of phosphate income were invested in trust funds to help cushion the transition and provide for Nauru 's economic future . As a result of heavy spending from the trust funds , the government faced virtual bankruptcy . To cut costs the government has frozen wages and reduced overstaffed public service departments . Nauru lost further revenue in 2008 with the closure of Australia 's refugee processing center , making it almost totally dependent on food imports and foreign aid . Housing , hospitals , and other capital plant are deteriorating . Meanwhile , U.S. officials say all aid flights from abroad will be directed to an Air Force base in Arkansas , before being sent to the devastated U.S. Gulf Coast . The cost to Australia of keeping the government and economy afloat continues to climb . Few comprehensive statistics on the Nauru economy exist with estimates of Nauru 's GDP varying widely . The French colonies of Senegal and the French Sudan were merged in 1959 and granted their independence as the Mali Federation in 1960 . The union broke up after only a few months . Senegal joined with The Gambia to form the nominal confederation of Senegambia in 1982 . The envisaged integration of the two countries was never carried out , and the union was dissolved in 1989 . The Movement of Democratic Forces in the Casamance ( MFDC ) has led a low-level separatist insurgency in southern Senegal since the 1980s , and several peace deals have failed to resolve the conflict . Nevertheless , Senegal remains one of the most stable democracies in Africa . Senegal was ruled by a Socialist Party for 40 years until current President Abdoulaye WADE was elected in 2000 . He was reelected in February 2007 and has amended Senegal 's constitution over a dozen times to increase executive power and to weaken the opposition , part of the president 's increasingly autocratic governing style . The United Nations nuclear agency says it has no information to support a recent media report of an undeclared nuclear facility in Syria . Senegal has a long history of participating in international peacekeeping and regional mediation . A CERTAIN HUNTER , having snared a hare , placed it upon his shoulders and set out homewards . On his way he met a man on horseback who begged the hare of him , under the pretense of purchasing it . However , when the Horseman got the hare , he rode off as fast as he could . The Hunter ran after him , as if he was sure of overtaking him , but the Horseman increased more and more the distance between them . The Hunter , sorely against his will , called out to him and said , \" Get along with you ! for I will now make you a present of the hare . \" A physicist and a mathematician are sitting in a faculty lounge . Suddenly , the coffee machine catches on fire . The physicist grabs a bucket and leap towards the sink , filled the bucket with water and puts out the fire . Second day , the same two sit in the same lounge . A spokeswoman , Melissa Fleming , for the International Atomic Energy Agency says her agency would investigate any relevant information on the subject . Again , the coffee machine catches on fire . This time , the mathematician stands up , got a bucket , hands the bucket to the physicist , thus reducing the problem to a previously solved one . President Bush says he is starting the process of picking the cabinet and White House staff for his second term in office . Mr. Bush , spending the weekend at the presidential retreat , Camp David , in Maryland , did not indicate what changes he is considering for his team . U.S. media reports , however , say Attorney General John Ashcroft could depart before Mr. Bush is sworn in for a second term in January . Others reportedly considering leaving include Secretary of State Colin Powell and Homeland Security Chief Tom Ridge . Meanwhile , U.S. counterterrorism coordinator Cofer Black has resigned his post , becoming the first to leave since President Bush 's re-election . He had served the State Department since 2002 , and had previously worked for the CIA for nearly three decades . The U.S. Army 's top general says the Army is planning for the possibility of keeping the current number of troops in Iraq - well over 1,00,000 - for four more years . General Peter Schoomaker told the Associated Press Saturday he was confident the Army could continue to provide the current number of forces in Iraq for several more years . The meeting took place on the sidelines of the Ibero-American Summit in San Jose , Costa Rica , where heads of state were meeting to discuss a candidate to head the Organization of American States and other regional issues . She said the IAEA expects any country with information about nuclear-related activity of another country to provide that information to the IAEA . President Bush , in his weekly radio address , expressed confidence in what he called the \" ultimate triumph of our cause . \" In Saturday 's Democratic radio address , former Senator Max Cleland of Georgia said Mr. Bush 's plan for victory is not working . Mr. Cleland said the United States needs a strategy to win in Iraq or an exit strategy to leave . Mr. Bush has said there will be no timetable for withdrawing the troops , because that would signal the United States is weak . Iran is insisting it will resume uranium conversion this week , after rejecting European incentives to end its nuclear fuel work . Speaking Sunday in Tehran , a Foreign Ministry spokesman said work at Iran 's Isfahan nuclear plant will begin once the International Atomic Energy Agency installs surveillance cameras . The IAEA says inspection equipment will be in place by mid-week . British , French and German negotiators have called an emergency meeting of the IAEA on Tuesday to issue Tehran a final warning against restarting the fuel program . Western governments suspect Iran 's nuclear activities are aimed at developing atomic weaponry . Tehran insists its nuclear intentions are peaceful . The New York Times newspaper reported Sunday that an Israeli air strike on Syria last month targeted a partially built nuclear reactor . If the stand-off continues , the Europeans say they will ask the U.N. Security Council to consider imposing economic sanctions to force Tehran to end its fuel work . Israel 's attorney general has ordered a new criminal investigation into Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , who is facing two other police probes . A Justice Ministry statement says the new probe will focus on political appointments made while Mr. Olmert was trade and industry minister . The police will also look into suspicions Mr. Olmert assisted his political friends in different public bodies . The prime minister says the new investigation is unnecessary and will be closed without any results . Last week , police questioned Mr. Olmert about allegations he tried to steer the sale of government-owned Bank Leumi in 2005 while he was acting finance minister . Mr. Olmert also is under investigation for his purchase of a Jerusalem apartment in 2004 . He allegedly received a discounted price in return for helping the builder obtain construction permits from the city government . A British newspaper reports that United Nations peacekeepers in southern Sudan are facing allegations of raping and sexually abusing children as young as 12 . The Daily Telegraph says it based its story on an internal report by the United Nations Children 's Fund . The article , which cited unidentified U.S. and foreign officials , said the nuclear reactor was modeled on one North Korea used for stockpiling nuclear fuel . The newspaper says the alleged abuse started shortly after U.N. peacekeepers arrived in southern Sudan in March , 2005 . One 13-year-old alleged victim said U.N. personnel enticed him into their car with money , sexually abused him , then tossed him out with no cash . A British peacekeeping official has already denied the charges . But a senior U.N. official has told the Associated Press that the allegations will be treated seriously and investigated . U.N. officials fired one peacekeeper and suspended several others without pay in 2005 for allegations of bribing women and girls for sex in the Democratic Republic of Congo . Gunmen in Iraq attacked a local police chief 's convoy Saturday , wounding him and two others . The police chief was traveling near Mosul when militants fired on the motorcade . The attack sparked a clash between police and militants that left one officer dead and at least one other person wounded . Another policeman was killed and at least two others wounded when a roadside bomb exploded near their patrol outside Fallujah . The European Union under the rotating presidency of Slovenia says it will seek to move forward with accession talks with Turkey . U.S. officials said the site was identified by satellite photographs earlier this year . Speaking in the Slovenian capital , Prime Minister Janez Jansa told reporters Monday that he will seek the total support of all EU member-countries for expanded accession talks . Turkey is an official candidate for EU membership . But its entry bid has roused opposition , most notably from France . President Nicolas Sarkozy has said repeatedly that largely-Muslim Turkey should be offered a privileged partnership rather than full membership . The internationally recognized Greek-led government of Cyprus also opposes Turkish EU membership . Turkey has refused to open trade and travel links with the Cyprus government , as part of its ongoing territorial dispute over the divided island . The first members of a U.N. peacekeeping mission for southern Sudan have arrived in the country to help implement a January peace deal . Twelve Nepalese soldiers flew into the central town of El-Obeid Wednesday , one of the main operational centers for aid agencies working in the south . The soldiers are part of an eventual deployment of 10,000 peacekeeping troops . The force will come mostly from Bangladesh , China , Egypt , India , Kenya and Zambia . The IAEA says it is in contact with Syrian authorities to verify the authenticity of the report . The conflict in southern Sudan lasted more than two decades and claimed more than two million lives , mostly from war-induced famine and disease . It is separate from the conflict in Sudan 's western Darfur region . More than 2,000 African Union troops have been deployed there to monitor a cease-fire . Indonesia 's national police chief says one of Southeast Asia 's most wanted men may be dead . General Sutanto says they hope to confirm the death of Malaysian bomb maker Azahari bin Husin Thursday . Indonesian police raided a suspected militant hideout in Batu , in East Java Province Wednesday . At least three people are thought to be dead from the gunbattle and explosions that rocked the house . Police fear the building may be booby trapped and will wait for daylight before retrieving the bodies and making further investigations . Witnesses say Azahari bin Husin may have blown himself up rather than be captured by police . The fugitive terrorist is linked to Jemaah Islamiyah , a group seen as the regional arm of al-Qaida , and is accused of masterminding at least four deadly blasts in Indonesia , including the 2002 Bali bombings that killed 202 people . The United Nations envoy to the Middle East has urged Israel to accept a new Syrian proposal to renew peace talks . A suicide bomber targeted a police station in Pakistan 's capital , Islamabad , Monday evening , killing himself and one officer .

The largest U.S. supplier of parts for the automotive industry has filed for bankruptcy protection . Reed International PLC said that net income for the six months ended Oct. 1 slipped 5 % to # 89.7 million ( $ 141.9 million ) , or 16 pence a share , from # 94.8 million ( $ 149.9 million ) , or 17.3 pence a share . The British paper , packaging and publishing concern , said profit from continuing lines fell 10 % to # 118 million from # 130.6 million . While there were no one-time gains or losses in the latest period , there was a one-time gain of # 18 million in the 1988 period . And while there was no profit this year from discontinued operations , last year they contributed # 34 million , before tax . Pretax profit fell 3.7 % to # 128 million from # 133 million and was below analysts ' expectations of # 130 million to # 135 million , but shares rose 6 pence to 388 pence in early trading yesterday in London . Reed is paying an interim dividend of 4.6 pence , up 15 % from 4 pence a year earlier . Sales fell 20 % to # 722 million . Earnings were hurt by disposal of operations in its restructuring , Reed said . The German economy - the fifth largest economy in the world in PPP terms and Europe 's largest - is a leading exporter of machinery , vehicles , chemicals , and household equipment and benefits from a highly skilled labor force . Like its western European neighbors , Germany faces significant demographic challenges to sustained long-term growth . Delphi Corporation filed a motion with the federal bankruptcy court in New York Saturday to reorganize its U.S. operations . Low fertility rates and declining net immigration are increasing pressure on the country 's social welfare system and necessitate structural reforms . The modernization and integration of the eastern German economy - where unemployment can exceed 20 % in some municipalities - continues to be a costly long-term process , with annual transfers from west to east amounting in 2008 alone to roughly $ 12 billion . Reforms launched by the government of Chancellor Gerhard SCHROEDER ( 1998 - 2005 ) , deemed necessary to address chronically high unemployment and low average growth , contributed to strong growth in 2006 and 2007 and falling unemployment . These advances , as well as a government subsidized , reduced working hour scheme , help explain the relatively modest increase in unemployment during the 2008 - 9 recession - the deepest since World War II - and its decrease to 7.4 % in 2010 . GDP contracted 4.7 % in 2009 but grew by 3.6 % in 2010 . In its annual projection for 2011 , the Federal Government expects the upswing to continue , with GDP forecast to grow this year at a real rate of 2.3 % . The recovery was attributable primarily to rebounding manufacturing orders and exports - increasingly outside the Euro Zone . Domestic demand , however , is becoming more significant driver of Germany 's economic expansion . Stimulus and stabilization efforts initiated in 2008 and 2009 and tax cuts introduced in Chancellor Angela MERKEL 's second term increased Germany 's budget deficit to 3.3 % in 2010 . The Bundesbank expects the deficit to drop to about 2.5 % in 2011 , below the EU 's 3 % limit . Delphi , which split off from its former parent , General Motors , six years ago , recently failed to win financial concessions from unions . A constitutional amendment approved in 2009 likewise limits the federal government to structural deficits of no more than 0.35 % of GDP per annum as of 2016 . Two centuries of Viking raids into Europe tapered off following the adoption of Christianity by King Olav TRYGGVASON in 994 . Conversion of the Norwegian kingdom occurred over the next several decades . In 1397 , Norway was absorbed into a union with Denmark that lasted more than four centuries . In 1814 , Norwegians resisted the cession of their country to Sweden and adopted a new constitution . Sweden then invaded Norway but agreed to let Norway keep its constitution in return for accepting the union under a Swedish king . Rising nationalism throughout the 19th century led to a 1905 referendum granting Norway independence . Although Norway remained neutral in World War I , it suffered heavy losses to its shipping . Norway proclaimed its neutrality at the outset of World War II , but was nonetheless occupied for five years by Nazi Germany ( 1940 - 45 ) . In 1949 , neutrality was abandoned and Norway became a member of NATO . The company 's chairman and chief executive officer , Robert Miller , told the Associated Press he hopes Delphi can emerge from bankruptcy protection within two years . Discovery of oil and gas in adjacent waters in the late 1960s boosted Norway 's economic fortunes . In referenda held in 1972 and 1994 , Norway rejected joining the EU . Key domestic issues include immigration and integration of ethnic minorities , maintaining the country 's extensive social safety net with an aging population , and preserving economic competitiveness . In 1959 , three years before independence from Belgium , the majority ethnic group , the Hutus , overthrew the ruling Tutsi king . Over the next several years , thousands of Tutsis were killed , and some 1,50,000 driven into exile in neighboring countries . The children of these exiles later formed a rebel group , the Rwandan Patriotic Front ( RPF ) , and began a civil war in 1990 . The war , along with several political and economic upheavals , exacerbated ethnic tensions , culminating in April 1994 in a state-orchestrated genocide , in which Rwandans killed up to a million of their fellow citizens , including approximately three-quarters of the Tutsi population . The genocide ended later that same year when the predominantly Tutsi RPF , operating out of Uganda and northern Rwanda , defeated the national army and Hutu militias , and established an RPF-led government of national unity . Approximately 2 million Hutu refugees - many fearing Tutsi retribution - fled to neighboring Burundi , Tanzania , Uganda , and Zaire . Since then , most of the refugees have returned to Rwanda , but several thousand remained in the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ; the former Zaire ) and formed an extremist insurgency bent on retaking Rwanda , much as the RPF tried in 1990 . The Israeli military began an offensive in Gaza after militants kidnapped an Israeli soldier in June . He said the firm will continue to negotiate with General Motors and its unions to lower labor costs . Rwanda held its first local elections in 1999 and its first post-genocide presidential and legislative elections in 2003 . Rwanda in 2009 staged a joint military operation with the Congolese Army in DRC to rout out the Hutu extremist insurgency there and Kigali and Kinshasa restored diplomatic relations . Rwanda also joined the Commonwealth in late 2009 . Tourism , commerce , and finance are the mainstays of Andorra 's tiny , well-to-do economy , accounting for more than three-quarters of GDP . An estimated 9 million tourists visit annually , attracted by Andorra 's duty-free status for some products and by its summer and winter resorts . Andorra 's comparative advantage eroded when the borders of neighboring France and Spain opened , providing broader availability of goods and lower tariffs . The banking sector also contributes substantially to the economy . Agricultural production is limited - only 2 % of the land is arable - and most food has to be imported .

Officials Saturday said the bodies were found in the Bekaa Valley town of Anjar . They say the bodies , one of which was dressed in a Lebanese military uniform , have been buried for years . The Syrian headquarters was notorious for the arrest and torture of Lebanese prisoners during its nearly three-decade presence in Lebanon . Mexican authorities have discovered the decapitated bodies of 12 men , including some believed to be soldiers , in the southern state of Guerrero . Authorized by the Arab League , Syria first moved troops into Lebanon in 1976 to try to maintain order one year after the outbreak of the country 's devastating 15-year civil war . Damascus was forced to withdraw its troops earlier this year under intense domestic and international pressure after senior Syrian officials were implicated in the murder of former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri .

Mr. Aristide 's Miami-based lawyer , Ira Kurzban , says the allegations are politically motivated and have no basis in fact . Mr. Kurzban also tells VOA the charges are a public relations ploy to divert attention from a government he says was not elected and that is engaged in gross human rights violations .

But a spokesman for the opposition group said the meeting was intended for experts , not top leaders . The pro-Russian party has been blocking parliamentary proceedings for the past week by barring access to the podium .

By a narrow 05-Apr vote Monday , the justices said smokers may use state consumer protection laws to sue companies for the way they promote \" low tar \" or \" light \" cigarettes . The case stems from a class action lawsuit from three residents in the northeastern state of Maine who alleged manufacturers hid information that \" light \" cigarettes are as dangerous as regular ones .
